* Introduction

Even before the first detection of an exoplanetary system, planets
were predicted to migrate from their initial position due to
interactions with their natal protoplanetary disk
cite:lin79_tidal_torques_accret_discs_binar,goldreich_excitation_1979,goldreich_disk-satellite_1980-1.
The associated angular momentum and energy exchange acts to reshape
the orbital architecture during the first million years of a system's
life, in particular the planets' semimajor axes and eccentricities.
This process is collectively known as planetary migration
cite:nelson_planetary_2018.

When two planets' periods are related by an integer fraction $j$:$j+k$
(e.g. 2:1, 3:2), mutual gravitational interactions can lock orbits
into mean motion resonances (MMRs).  MMRs are characterized by the
libration of two angles specific to the values of $j$ and $k$.  If
$k=1$, i.e. $j$:$j+1$ for some $j$, the gravitational interactions are
first order in eccentricity and inclination.  The resonance angles for
first order MMRs are given by
#+BEGIN_SRC latex
  \begin{align}
  \label{circangles1}
   \theta_1 &= (j+1)\lambda_2 - \lambda_1 - \varpi_1 \\
  \label{circangles2}
   \theta_2 &= (j+1)\lambda_2 - \lambda_1 - \varpi_2.
  \end{align}
#+END_SRC
@@latex:\noindent@@ The mean longitudes of the inner and outer planets
are denoted by $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$, respectively, and
$\varpi_1$ and $\varpi_2$ denote their longitudes of perihelion.  If
the angles $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ librate around $\pi$ and $0$,
respectively, the system is said to be in resonance.  As a planet
migrates, its resonance locations sweep across the disk and capture
planets into resonant pairs and chains.  The MMR equilibrium is
governed by various conditions which are well studied in the
literature
cite:henrard_second_1983,deck_migration_2015,goldreich_overstable_2014,xu_migration_2018,henrard_second_1983.
The resonant pair's path across the disk, characterized by the
direction, distance traveled, and migration and eccentricity damping
timescales, determines the final orbital architecture for the system
cite:cresswell_evolution_2006,cresswell_three-dimensional_2008.

In the past 40 years, exoplanet surveys have given us a wealth of
systems to test our understanding of disk migration and resonant
dynamics.  Thousands of exoplanet systems have been discovered, and,
although many resonant systems have been found, the proportion of such
systems is low compared to theoretical expectations based on disk
migration cite:fabrycky_architecture_2014.  In addition to the paucity
of planets in MMRs, there also seems to be an overabundance of planets
just outside of mean motion resonances, with period ratios slightly
larger than 2 or 3/2
cite:fabrycky_architecture_2014,choksi_sub-neptune_2020.  A system's
orbital architecture can reveal details about its history.
Commensurate period ratios may indicate past resonant interactions
within the planetary system, but the present state of the resonance
can only be determined by analyzing the behavior of the angles in
equations eqref:circangles1 and eqref:circangles2.  Furthermore, since
these angles are related by $\theta_2-\theta_1=\varpi_1-\varpi_2$,
this implies that a resonant pair of planets will have
$\Delta\varpi\equiv \varpi_1-\varpi_2\approx \pi$.

NASA's \emph{Kepler} mission observed several planet pairs near a
first-order resonance with constraints on $\Delta\varpi$, such as
Kepler-88 cite:weiss_discovery_2020 and Kepler-24
cite:antoniadou_exploiting_2020. Both of these systems are apsidally
anti-aligned ($\Delta\varpi\approx180^\circ$).  Kepler-9b and
Kepler-9c are near to the 2:1 resonace and apsidally anti-aligned, but
their angles $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ likely circulate.  However, a
puzzling resonant architecture has been discovered recently in the
system K2-19.

NASA's \emph{K2} mission initially discovered the planets K2-19b and c
near a 3:2 period ratio ($P_b=7.9$ d, $P_c=11.9$ d), and later on
planet K2-19d at $P_d=2.5$ d
cite:howell14_k2_mission,armstrong15_one_closes_exopl_pairs_to,sinukoff16_eleven_multip_system_fromk_masses.
K2-19 is a solar-type star ($M_*=0.88M_\odot$), planet b has
$M_{b}=10.8 M_{\oplus}$, and c has $M_{c}<10M_{\oplus}$.  Both outer
planets had moderate eccentricities $e_b\approx e_c\approx 0.2$.
Further observations revealed K2-19b and c to be apsidally
\emph{aligned}, with $\Delta\varpi\equiv \varpi_c-\varpi_b \approx
2\pm 2^\circ$ cite:petigura_k2-19b_2020.  Hence, the K2-19 system
poses a problem for the conventional understanding of planet migration
and resonance capture.

Investigating how K2-19 could have formed with $\Delta\varpi=0$
through resonance capture will offer us an insight into its dynamical
history as well as a better understanding of the genesis of extrasolar
orbital configurations.  In this paper, we review the analytically
simple migration model commonly used in the literature.  In Section
[[Standard Picture of Resonance Capture]], we present the classical
picture of resonant capture and explore the parameter space for the
coupling between the resonant eccentricities and the protoplanetary
disk. We fail to find any disk conditions which robustly lead to
apsidal alignment.  In Section [[Test Particle Results]], we explore
apsidal alignment for a test particle in the vicinity of an eccentric
planet's MMR. The test particle results guide our analysis in Section
[[Apsidal Angle]], where we design a toy model which relies on
eccentricity diriving to a finite, non-zero value and argue that it
can reproduce the apsidal alignment between K2-19b and c. We
demonstrate that the orbital architecture of K2-19 can be explained by
an external force which pumps the eccentricities beyond their
equilibrium values.

*** Dissipative forces                                             :ignore:
Planets embedded within a protoplanetary disk interact gravitationally
with the gas and lose angular momentum, leading to inward migration
towards the central star.  Disk torques vary with planet mass as well
as across semimajor axis; large outer planets lose angular momentum
quickly and sweep up inner planets into MMRs

cases, the planet can gain angular momentum and migrate away from the
primary.

In this paper, we will ignore the detailed physics of planet-disk
interactions and instead implement a proxy for dissipative forces
parametrized by the eccentricity damping and migration timescales,
denoted by $T_{e,i}$ and $T_{m,i}$ for $i=1,2$.  We will denote all
quantities relevant to the inner planet with the subscript $1$, and the
outer with $2$.  The equations of motion for disk effects are:

Keplerian Hamiltonian; $H_{\rm res}$ the resonant interactions between
the planets of order $\O(e_i)$; and $H_{\rm sec}$ the secular
interactions.  The two resonant angles are given as in equations
eqref:circangles1 and eqref:circangles2.

The Hamiltonian system defined by equation eqref:hamiltonian admits
seven independent coupled ordinary differential equations, which we
may integrate together with the effects of dissipation to simulate MMR
capture.  We utilize the $\mathtt{scipy}$ Python package with the
Runge-Kutta method of order 5(4) and a relative and absolute tolerance
$\epsilon=10^{-9}$.  The resonance angles are initialized over a
uniform distribution between $0^\circ$ and $360^\circ$.  At $t=0$, we
set $a_1=1~\mathrm{au}$, $P_2/P_1=1.6$, and $e_1=e_2=0.001$.  Table
ref:tab:ICs summarizes our simulation parameters for this section and
the next two.

An example of MMR capture is given in Figure ref:fig:standardex.  The
period ratio $P_2/P_1$ initially starts wide of the nominal resonance
value.  After around $2~\rm{kyr}$ of convergent migration, the planets
are caught into MMR, indicated by the stabilization of $\theta_1$ to
$180^\circ$ and $\theta_2$ to $0^\circ$.  The planets' eccentricities
level off at their equilibrium values near $e_1\approx 0.008$ and
$e_2\approx0.016$, and the planets become apsidally anti-aligned with
$\varpi_1-\varpi_2\approx 180^\circ$.

In this paper, we will use the term "resonance" to mean the libration
of an angle such as $\theta_1$, $\theta_2$, and later on $\hat\theta$.
We'll also use the angle itself to refer to the resonance, i.e. the
planets $m_1$ and $m_2$ in Figure ref:fig:standardex are caught into
both $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$, respectively, since those angles are
librating.

By solving the four equations [[eqref:dote1]] -- eqref:dotdpom and
[[eqref:doteta]], we can calculate the equilibrium values for the system.
In the standard picture and neglecting secular terms (i.e., for small
$e_i$), equations [[eqref:dote1]] and [[eqref:dote2]] show
$\sin(\theta_i)\approx 0$.  Equation [[eqref:dotdpom]] gives us
$\abs{\cos\theta_i} \approx 1$ and $\cos\theta_1 = -\cos\theta_2$, but
the solution $(\theta_1,\theta_2)=(0,\pi)$ is unstable.  Hence,
$\theta_1\approx\pi$ and $\theta_2\approx 0$ in equilibrium.  Since
$\theta_1-\theta_2 = \varpi_2-\varpi_1$, we therefore see that
convergent migration produces anti-aligned periapses.  We confirm this
in the time-dependent integration in Figure ref:fig:standardex.

*** Standard model                                                 :ignore:
The equilibrium $e_i$'s and $\Delta\varpi$'s for comparable mass
planets $(q\in[0.5,2])$ are given in Figures ref:fig:standardeqecc and
[[ref:fig:standardDpom]].  Analytical solutions to the equilibrium
equations are plotted as dashed lines.
We compare the analytical results to a numerical integration of the 
time-dependent differential equations from Hamiltonian
eqref:hamiltonian and plot the average $e_1$, $e_2$, and
$\Delta\varpi$ over the last 10% of the timespan.  These results are
calculated with outward migration for $q>1$ and inward migration for
$q<1$.

As we can see in Figures ref:fig:standardeqecc and
ref:fig:standardDpom, the final averaged eccentricities for $m_1$ and
$m_2$ go approximately as $e_2/e_1 \sim q$. As expected, the
$\Delta\varpi$ average values are all very close to $180^\circ$. The
numerical and analytical results largely agree.  In the next two
sections, we will explore slightly modified models by varying the
ratio $T_{e,1}/T_{e,2}$ to test whether they can produce apsidal
alignment.

*** Damping Timescales                                             :ignore:
Up until now, we have strictly been considering the standard picture
of planet migration -- with $T_{e,1}/T_{e,2} = 1/q$ and
$T_{e,i}=3.46h^2T_{e,i}$ -- which always gives rise to apsidal
anti-alignment for reasonable disk conditions ($h\lesssim 0.1$,
$T_{e,i}\sim h^2 T_{m,i}$). This simple parametrized model fails to
capture the complicated hydrodynamics of real astrophysical disks, and
so we could therefore expect a difference in the ratio
$T_{e,1}/T_{e,2}$ over an order of magnitude.  We would like to
determine the effects of the eccentricity damping ratio on the
equilibrium values of $e_i$ and whether such a change could lead to
apsidal alignment.

We explore this possibility in Figures ref:fig:eqecc and
ref:fig:eqDpom. The ratio $T_{e,1}/T_{e,2}$ varies freely between
$0.2$ and $10$, regardless of the mass ratio.  The migration
timescales are still set to $\abs{T_{m,i}}=T_{e,i}/3.46 h^2$.  For
$T_{e,1}<T_{e,2}$, then, we set $T_{m,i}>0$, corresponding to outward
migration, and vice versa for $T_{e,1}>T_{e,2}$.

For comparable mass planets with $q=0.5$, $1$, and $2$, varying the
ratio $T_{e,1}/T_{e,2}$ around $1/q$ modifies the final equilibrium
eccentricities by a roughly similar factor, as seen in Figure
ref:fig:eqecc. The eccentricity ratio $e_1/e_2$ is largely unchanged,
yet the magnitudes $e_1$ and $e_2$ are larger for more extreme values
of $T_{e,1}/T_{e,2}$.  The dashed lines plot the analytic results from
solving equations [[eqref:dote1]] -- [[eqref:doteta]]; these findings
reproduce the numerical results.

The corresponding values for $\Delta\varpi$ are shown in Figure
ref:fig:eqDpom. In all cases, the analytic equilibrium
equations predict $\Delta\varpi\approx 180^\circ$, and the numerical
integrations agree.  We note that the equilibrium solutions given in
Figures ref:fig:standard - ref:fig:eqDpom are not continuous across
the line $T_{e,1}/T_{e_2} = 1$ (i.e. $q=1$ in Figure ref:fig:standard), which
is where we reverse the migration direction to ensure it is
convergent. Variations in the eccentricity damping ratio cannot
account for apsidal alignment.

The dynamics of first order MMRs with comparable mass planets are
complicated by the presence of two critical arguments in the
Hamiltonian equation eqref:hamiltonian, $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$.
By assuming that one of the planets is a test particle, i.e. $m_1=0$,
we can ignore the opposite resonance angle, $\theta_2$. The respective
case for an external test particle is setting $m_2=0$ while ignoring
the dynamics of $\theta_1$.  Furthermore, absent any external forces,
these assumptions imply the massive planet will remain on an
unchanging orbit.  To emphasize the fact that we are only considering
the dynamics of the test particle, we adopt the following notation:
The subscript $p$ will denote the constant orbital elements and
coordinate-momentum pairs of the massive planet, while no subscript will
indicate these quantities for the test particles.

We assume that no dissipative forces act on the massive perturber
while implementing a migration model identical to the one used in
Section [[Standard Picture of Resonance Capture]] for the test particle.
Equivalently, the dissipative timescales acting on the massive planet
are assumed to approach infinity.  To remain consistent with notation,
we label the sma- and $e\text{-damping}$ for the test particle as
$T_{m}$ and $T_{e}$, respectively. This problem is well-studied in the
literature, and so in lieu of a detailed derivation we briefly
summarize the problem with references to the key results.

** Equations of motion
The Hamiltonian, including secular effects, for a test particle in the
vicinity of an interior MMR is

    \label{eq:tpext}
    H
    &= - \frac{1}{2(a/a_p)} + \mu_p\left(f_1

#+END_SRC

In these two Hamiltonians, $\theta_p$ is now an explicit function of
time, since $\lambda_p=n_p t$ and $\varpi_p=0$ is constant.  For
simplicity, we first consider the case for which the massive planet is
on a circular orbit, i.e. $e_p=0$, so we may ignore the $\lambda$ in
$\theta_p$. This problem is known as the circular restricted three
body problem (CR3BP), while $e_p>0$ is the eccentric restricted three
body problem (ER3BP).  In Figure ref:fig:tp-ep0, we've plotted an
example of a test particle captured into an external resonance with
$h=0.03$, $\mu_p = 10^{-4}$, and $T_{e} = 1000$.  The test particle is
captured into the $\theta_2$ resonance, while its longitude of
perihelion, $\varpi$, and the other resonance angle, $\theta_1$,
circulates.

** Equilibrium eccentricity and stability
When a test particle is caught into a stable resonance, its
eccentricity grows and saturates at a finite value which depends on
the ratio $T_{e}/T_{m}$.  For a detailed derivation, see e.g.
[[cite:&goldreich_overstable_2014]] and [[cite:&xu_migration_2018]].
By setting $\dot\eta=0$ (equation\ref{doteta}), equilibrium
in $e$ arises once the forces of migration into the resonance, $T_m$, balances
the forces of eccentricity damping, $T_e$. For an internal
test particle, the equilibrium eccentricity is
#+BEGIN_SRC latex
  \begin{equation}
  \label{eq:eeqint}
    e_{\rm eq} = \sqrt{\frac{T_e}{2(j+1)T_m}} = h\sqrt{\frac{1.78}{j+1}}.
  \end{equation}
#+END_SRC
For an external test particle,
#+BEGIN_SRC latex
  \begin{equation}
  \label{eq:eeqext}
    e_{\rm eq} = \sqrt{\frac{T_e}{2jT_m}} = h\sqrt{\frac{1.78}{j}}.
  \end{equation}
#+END_SRC

For a test particle, capture occurs if migration is slow enough so that
[[citep:&goldreich_overstable_2014]]
#+BEGIN_SRC latex
  \begin{equation}
  \mu_p^{4/3} \geq \frac{2.5}{j^{5/3}n T_m}.
  \end{equation}
#+END_SRC
If captured into an external resonance, the test particle equilibrium
is stable. However, for an interior resonance, if the equilibrium
eccentricity is larger than
#+BEGIN_SRC latex
  \begin{equation}
    \frac{3j^2}{8\alpha_0 \abs{f_1}}e_{\rm eq}^3 > \mu_p
  \end{equation}
#+END_SRC
then the capture is only temporary and the particle escapes after a
long enough time. On the other hand, if the eccentricity is smaller
than
#+BEGIN_SRC latex
  \begin{equation}
    \frac{3j}{\alpha_0 \abs{f_1}}e_{\rm eq}^3 < \mu_p
  \end{equation}
#+END_SRC
then the particle librates around its equilibrium eccentricity with
finite amplitude. Otherwise, the particles' librations in eccentricity
damp to zero around $e_{\rm eq}$.

** Eccentric massive planet
\note{explain varying ep and h figure} Now, after considering the
CR3BP, we may move on to the ER3BP, where $e_p>0$.  For moderate
eccentricities, $0<e_p\lesssim 0.1$, the qualitative features of the
CR3BP are preserved as long as $e_p \lesssim e_{\rm eq}$. In Figure
ref:fig:tp-circ, we have plotted the capture outcome with the same
parameters as Figure ref:fig:tp-ep0 but setting $e_p = 0.04$. As we
can see, the particle is still captured into resonance and $\theta_2$
begins librating around 180$^\circ$. The eccentricity $e$ librates
around its equilibrium value with large amplitude. The test particles
longitude of perihelion, $\varpi$, still circulates.

On the other hand, if $e_p \gtrsim e_{\rm eq}$, the test particle's
migration halts near the nominal resonance location of $P_2/P_1=1.5$
while both $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ continue to circulate. The particle's
eccentricity librates with slightly larger amplitude than
in the previous case. Finally, the system becomes apsidally aligned.

In Figure ref:fig:tp-grid-ext, we summarize the behavior of
$\Delta\varpi$ for an internal and external test particle while
varying the values $e_p$ and $h$ (and subsequently $e_{\rm eq}$). Runs
which escape are not included in the figure. Generally, for large
enough $e_{\rm eq}\gtrsim e_p$, the system becomes apsidally
aligned. With additional simulations, the bifurcation between circulation
and apsidal alignment is sharp up to an error of @@latex:$\sim$ 10\%@@.

These test particle results motivate the eccentricity driving ansatz
we employ in the next section for comparable mass planets. We
demonstrate that there is a resonance $\hat\theta$ which operates
independently of the $\theta_i$ resonances and traps the planets into
resonance despite the circulation of both $\theta_i$. For a detailed
analysis of how $\hat\theta$ reduces from the comparable mass
($0<q<\infty$) case to the test particle case ($q\to0$ or
$q\to\infty$), see Section [[Test particle limit]].

* Apsidal Angle
** pretext                                                          :ignore:
As we have seen, capture into the $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ resonance
always leads to $\Delta\varpi\approx 180^\circ$ due to their
equilibrium values being close to $180^\circ$ and $0^\circ$,
respectively.  The apsidally aligned K2-19 system therefore poses a
problem for our standard model.  In order to match this observation,
either $\theta_1$, $\theta_2$, or both angles must circulate.

In the previous section, we saw that apsidal alignment arises whenever
the massive planet has an eccentricity larger than the equilibrium
eccentricity of the test particle in resonance. If this is the case,
the CR3BP resonance angle circulates and $e$ librates with large
amplitude, but the particle is still trapped near the period resonance
location, $P_2/P_1=1.5$.  Guided by this result, in this section, we
formulate a toy model for driving the eccentricities of comparable
mass planets to an arbitrary value and explore the resulting apsidal
angle. Then, we reduce the Hamiltonian of the system to a single
degree of freedom through a series of canonical transformations.  This
formulation allows us to identify the key dynamical processes that
lead to alignment. Finally, we take the test particle limit of the
Hamiltonian to connect $\varpi$-alignment in the comparable mass to
the results in the previous section.

The planets K2-19b and c are moderately eccentric, with $e_{b}\approx
e_c\approx 0.2$ citep:petigura_k2-19b_2020.  One way of escaping the
circular $\theta_i$ resonances is to artificially drive the
eccentricity of the system to values where equation eqref:dotdpom may
be broken.  We modify the eccentricity damping for $m_i$ in equation
eqref:eq:disforce to be

@@latex:\noindent@@ so that planet $m_i$ is  driven to
$e_{i,d}$ with a timescale of $T_{e,i}$.

In Figure ref:fig:drivingex, we demonstrate the feasibility of this
approach, where we integrate the time-dependent equations while
driving the inner planet's eccentricity to $e_{1,d}=0.2$.  The outer
planet has $e_{2,d}=0.0$ and the mass ratio is $q=2$.  We initalize
the system with $e_{1}=e_2=0.001$ at the nominal resonance location,
$P_{2}/P_1 = 1.5$. The planets are caught in the $\theta_1$ and
$\theta_2$ resonances for 10,000 years, after which the planets escape
and the angles circulate. At this point, both planets' ecentricities
are excited to about $e_i\approx 0.2$ and the planets become apsidally
aligned as $\Delta\varpi$ librates around $0^\circ$ with a large
amplitude.  Despite the circulation of both resonance angles, the
period ratio remains locked very close to the nominal resonance
location ($P_2/P_1= 1.5$). The system is caught in a different type of
resonance which we will study in the following subsection.

On the other hand, for $e_{2,d}=0.2$ and $e_{1,d}=0$, the sytem
displays different resonance behavior.  We have plotted the details of
this system in Figure ref:fig:perpex. The angle $\theta_2$ librates
with large amplitude around its resonant value of $0^\circ$, whereas
$\theta_1$ librates around $270^\circ$ rather than $180^\circ$.  As a
result, $\Delta\varpi$ approaches $90^\circ$ and so the planets'
perihelia are now perpendicular to each other.

A detailed analysis of the MMR Hamiltonian eqref:hamiltonian
illustrates the underlying dynamics behind the capture processes in
Figure ref:fig:drivingex which lead to apsidal alignment.  It can be
shown that $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ are actually subresonances of a
resonance $\hat\theta$ which arises after transforming the system's
Hamiltonian so that it has only a single degree of freedom. 

If we assume that the semimajor axis ratio $\alpha$ is stationary or
varying adiabatically, we may transform the resonant Hamiltonian
$H_{\rm Kep} + H_{\rm res}$ in equation [[eqref:hamiltonian]] into the
form
#+begin_src latex
  \begin{equation}
    \label{hhat}
    \hat H(\hat R,\hat\theta) = -3(\delta+1) \hat R + \hat R^2 - 2\sqrt{2\hat R} \cos(\hat\theta)
  \end{equation}
#+end_src
@@latex:\noindent@@ through a series of rotations in phase space.  For
the details of these transformations, see Appendix [[Reducing the
Hamiltonian to a single degree of freedom]].  The parameter $\delta$
quantifies the system's depth into resonance.  We do not include
$H_{\rm sec}$ in this analysis because it is second order in
eccentricities.

First order MMRs are typically treated as the circular restricted
three body problem (CR3BP), where one of the planets is a test
particle and the other is on a circular orbit. These are limiting
cases of the Hamiltonian given in equation eqref:hamiltonian for
comparable mass planets. For an inner (outer) test particle, $m_1=0$
($m_2=0$), $m_2$ ($m_1$) is finite, and $q$ approaches infinity
(zero).  In the CR3BP limit, the action angles are $\theta_1$ and
$\theta_2$ for the internal and external cases, respectively.  The
actions for the CR3BP are proportional to
#+begin_src latex
  \begin{align}
  \label{eq:R2limit}

#+end_src

One can see that the actions given above for the CR3BP are functions
of the test particles' eccentricities only, as the massive planets'
eccentricities are assumed to be zero.  On the other hand, for the
case where $q>0$ is finite, both planets will be on eccentric
osculating orbits.  Hence, we expect the action $\hat R$ in equation
eqref:hhat to be a function of both $e_1$ and $e_2$.

Define $\v{\hat e} = \abs{f_1}\v e_1 - \abs{f_2}\v e_2$ and $\hat e =
\abs{\v{\hat e}}$, where $\v e_i$ is the Runge-Lenz vector, i.e. the
vector with magnitude $e_i$ in the direction of perihelion.  The
action $\hat R$ takes the form $\hat R \propto \tilde \mu \hat e^2$,
where $\tilde\mu = m_1m_2/(m_1+m_2)$ is the reduced mass of the
planets. In order to recover the actions given above for the
appropriate CR3BP limits, we have

Under the assumption that the semimajor axes are stationary (or slowly
varying), the Hamiltonian in equation eqref:hamiltonian has two
degrees of freedom (dof) as written: the angles $\theta_1$ and
$\theta_2$.  However, by transforming this Hamiltonian into the single

The systems in Figures ref:fig:standardex, ref:fig:drivingex, and
ref:fig:perpex are representative of three different modes of
resonance, ones where $\Delta\varpi=180^\circ$,
$\Delta\varpi=0^\circ$, and $\Delta\varpi=90^\circ$,
respectively. These correspond to three different behaviors of the
quantities $\mathcal{S}_1$ and $\mathcal{S}_2$ while in resonance
under the influence of eccentricity forcing.

In Figure ref:fig:S2cons, we have plotted $\mathcal{S}_1$ and
$\mathcal{S}_2$ as well as $\dot S_2/S_2$ for these systems.  The top
row is for the standard eccentricity damping case where
$e_{1d}=e_{2d}=0$.  Once the system equilibrates, $S_2\approx 10^{-4}$
is well conserved (top left) and small. Both $\mathcal{S}_1$ and
$\mathcal{S}_2$ are also close to zero. From equations eqref:eq:sS1
and eqref:eq:sS1, we see this corresponds to $e_2/e_1 \sim q$, as we
found in Section [[Standard Picture of Resonance Capture]].

The second row corresponds to the integration shown in
ref:fig:drivingex, where $e_{1d}=0.2$ and $e_{2d}=0$.  For early
times, while the system is still caught in the $\theta_1$ and
$\theta_2$ resonances, $\mathcal{S}_1$, $\mathcal{S}_2$, and $S_2$ are
small.  Once the $\theta_i$ resonances are broken, and only
$\hat\theta$ librates, they are excited to larger values.  The
quantities $\mathcal{S}_1$ and $\mathcal{S}_2$ undergo large periodic
oscillations away from zero, while $S_2$ grows and then stabilizes at
its new equilibrium value, $S_2\approx 0.5$. The planets'
eccentricities oscillate in such a way as to conserve $S_2$.  The last
row corresponds to the integration in ref:fig:perpex, where
$e_{2d}=0.2$ and $e_{1d}=0$.  For this system, $\mathcal{S}_2$ is
conserved close to 0, while $\mathcal{S}_1$ grows to a magnitude
similar to its value in the apsidally aligned case.

In Figure ref:fig:relgeom, we plot the eccentricity
vectors $\mathbf{e}_{1}$, $\mathbf{e}_{2}$, and $\mathbf{\hat e}$
in the reference frame which rotates with $\mathbf{e}_1$.
The three systems begin with the same configuration,
caught in the $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ resonances.
The vectors $\mathbf{e}_1$ and $\mathbf{e}_2$ are anti-aligned,
while $\mathbf{\hat e}$ aligns with $\mathbf{e}_1$.
At later stages, the system without eccentricity driving
remains in this configuration (top row).

At later times, the second and third rows exhibit the new resonance
behaviors described above.  For the apsidally aligned case,
$\mathbf{e_2}$ circulates in a pattern strictly constrained to the
second and third quadrants, and $\mathbf{\hat e}$ circulates around
the other two vectors.  In the last row, $\mathbf{e}_1$ and
$\mathbf{e}_2$ are perpendicular to each other and $\mathbf{\hat e}$
is aligned with $\mathbf{e}_2$.

nominal resonance location, $P_2/P_1=1.5$, and a mass ratio $q=2$.
While fully understanding the dynamics of capture and stability of the
$\hat\theta$ resonance is beyond the scope of this paper, we can begin
to study the effects of initial conditions by slightly shifting the
starting location of the planets in the disk.

In the second row of Figure ref:fig:Rhat-grid, we have kept all of the
parameters from the first row constant, but shifted the starting
location of $m_2$ so that $P_2/P_1=1.55$. As we can see,
many more systems fail to capture and remain in resonance.

Figure BLANK displays the results of a simulation in which
the planets are captured into resonance only for a very brief time.

@@latex:\noindent@@ This form is valid for $q\in (0,\infty)$, and is
naturally extended to the case of an outer test particle by taking the
limit $q\to\infty$.  The extra factor of $q$ in front of $\mathcal K$
is so $q\tilde\mu$ reduces to $q\tilde\mu\to q\mu_2 \to \mu_1$ in the
$m_2=0$ test particle limit.  The coefficients in this case are given
by
#+BEGIN_SRC latex

    \mathcal M

      \frac{j}{\Lambda_1} - \frac{(j+1)\alpha^{3/2}}{\Lambda_2}

and $\mathcal{K}$ also exists for which the limit $q\to 0$ converges
to the case of an inner test particle by exchanging the necessary
factors of $q$ for $\Lambda_1/\Lambda_2 = q\sqrt\alpha$.
