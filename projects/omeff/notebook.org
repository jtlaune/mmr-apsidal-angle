** DONE "both planets can be captured for small omeff over long enough times"

muext=1e-3
mutot=1e-3
aext=15
e1d=e2d=0
==> m2 is captured into theta1 and m1<->theta2

muext=1e-3
mutot=1e-3
aext=10
e1d=e2d=0
==> m2 is *not* captured into theta1 *but* still m1<->theta2
- it appears theta1 is about to capture m2, possibly run more time
  - [[*get computer account on exo][get computer account on exo]]
- only ran for weak precession so far, could precession totally
  disrupt capture?

    Have shown that there is a change in behavior from
    0 to 1 that occurs x>0
