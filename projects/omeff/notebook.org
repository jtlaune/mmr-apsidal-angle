**** DONE try q<1
- nothing
**** TODO try -omeff [0/1]
code only worked for small omeff, i.e. kept crashing, nans
- in definition of omeff, flipped omeff=om2-om2 to omeff=om1-om2
- new behavior: code equilibrates into resonance for small omeff
  - [[file:q2.0/h-0.03-Tw0-1000-mutot-1.0e-03/omeff--1.6e-07-e1d-0.000-e2d-0.000.png]]
  - raise omeff: code equilibrates into some resonances
    - [[file:q2.0/h-0.03-Tw0-1000-mutot-1.0e-03/omeff--4.6e-07-e1d-0.000-e2d-0.000.png]]
    - [[file:q2.0/h-0.03-Tw0-1000-mutot-1.0e-03/omeff--5.4e-07-e1d-0.000-e2d-0.000.png]]
    - various behaviors/timescales to escape resonance. these runs begin
      /in/ resonance, at period ratio = 1.5
- this should explain why the code only started to work with very low
  "negative" omeff frequencies
***** TODO [#A] check math

* Commit notes [1/1]                                               :noexport:
** DONE "both planets can be captured for small omeff over long enough times"

muext=1e-3
mutot=1e-3
aext=15
e1d=e2d=0
==> m2 is captured into theta1 and m1<->theta2

muext=1e-3
mutot=1e-3
aext=10
e1d=e2d=0
==> m2 is *not* captured into theta1 *but* still m1<->theta2
- it appears theta1 is about to capture m2, possibly run more time
  - [[*get computer account on exo][get computer account on exo]]
- only ran for weak precession so far, could precession totally
  disrupt capture?

    Show behavior convergence from omeff>0 to 0
    
    Have shown that there is a change in behavior from
    0 to 1 that occurs x>0
* Possible inquiries
** can rings of dust interacting in MMRs affect ring dynamics?
- [[cite:&izidoro21_planet_rings_as_cause_solar]]
- can you model the evolution of planetessimal rings in late stage PPD
  as mass rings under the influence of a weak gas disk?
