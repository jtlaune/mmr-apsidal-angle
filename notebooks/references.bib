  abstract =	 {The Athena MHD code has been extended to integrates
                  the motion of particles coupled with the gas via
                  aerodynamic drag, in order to study the dynamics of
                  gas and solids in protoplanetary disks and the
                  formation of planetesimals. Our particle-gas hybrid
                  scheme is based on a second order
                  predictor-corrector method. Careful treatment of the
                  momentum feedback on the gas guarantees exact
                  conservation. The hybrid scheme is stable and
                  convergent in most regimes relevant to
                  protoplanetary disks. We describe a semi-implicit
                  integrator generalized from the leap-frog
                  approach. In the absence of drag force, it preserves
                  the geometric properties of a particle orbit. We
                  also present a fully-implicit integrator that is
                  unconditionally stable for all regimes of
                  particle-gas coupling. Using our hybrid code, we
                  study the numerical convergence of the non-linear
                  saturated state of the streaming instability. We
                  find that gas flow properties are well converged
                  with modest grid resolution (128 cells per pressure
                  length {\textbackslash}eta r for dimensionless
                  stopping time tau\_s=0.1), and equal number of
                  particles and grid cells. On the other hand,
                  particle clumping properties converge only at higher
                  resolutions, and finer resolution leads to stronger
                  clumping before convergence is reached. Finally, we
                  find that measurement of particle transport
                  properties resulted from the streaming instability
                  may be subject to error of about 20\%.},

  abstract =	 {(Abridged) We present local 2D and 3D hybrid
                  numerical simulations of particles and gas in the
                  midplane of protoplanetary disks (PPDs) using the
                  Athena code. The particles are coupled to gas
                  aerodynamically, with particle-to-gas feedback
                  included. Magnetorotational turbulence is ignored as
                  an approximation for the dead zone of PPDs, and we
                  ignore particle self-gravity to study the precursor
                  of planetesimal formation. Our simulations include a
                  wide size distribution of particles, ranging from
                  strongly coupled particles with dimensionless
                  stopping time tau\_s=Omega t\_stop=1e-4 to
                  marginally coupled ones with tau\_s=1 (where Omega
                  is the orbital frequency, t\_stop is the particle
                  friction time), and a wide range of solid
                  abundances. Our main results are: 1. Particles with
                  tau\_s{\textgreater}=0.01 actively participate in
                  the streaming instability, generate turbulence and
                  maintain the height of the particle layer before
                  Kelvin-Helmholtz instability is triggered. 2. Strong
                  particle clumping as a consequence of the streaming
                  instability occurs when a substantial fraction of
                  the solids are large (tau\_s{\textgreater}=0.01) and
                  when height-integrated solid to gas mass ratio Z is
                  super-solar. 3. The radial drift velocity is reduced
                  relative to the conventional Nakagawa-Sekiya-Hayashi
                  (NSH) model, especially at high Z. We derive a
                  generalized NSH equilibrium solution for multiple
                  particle species which fits our results very
                  well. 4. Collision velocity between particles with
                  tau\_s{\textgreater}=0.01 is dominated by
                  differential radial drift, and is strongly reduced
                  at larger Z. 5. There exist two positive feedback
                  loops with respect to the enrichment of local disk
                  solid abundance and grain growth. All these effects
                  promote planetesimal formation.},

  abstract =	 {Recent laser-plasma experiments report the existence
                  of dynamically significant magnetic fields, whose
                  statistical characterisation is essential for
                  understanding the physical processes these
                  experiments are attempting to investigate. In this
                  paper, we show how a proton imaging diagnostic can
                  be used to determine a range of relevant magnetic
                  field statistics, including the magnetic-energy
                  spectrum. To achieve this goal, we explore the
                  properties of an analytic relation between a
                  stochastic magnetic field and the image-flux
                  distribution created upon imaging that field. We
                  conclude that features of the beam's final
                  image-flux distribution often display a universal
                  character determined by a single, field-scale
                  dependent parameter - the contrast parameter - which
                  quantifies the relative size of the correlation
                  length of the stochastic field, proton displacements
                  due to magnetic deflections, and the image
                  magnification. For stochastic magnetic fields, we
                  establish the existence of four contrast regimes -
                  linear, nonlinear injective, caustic and diffusive -
                  under which proton-flux images relate to their
                  parent fields in a qualitatively distinct manner. As
                  a consequence, it is demonstrated that in the linear
                  or nonlinear injective regimes, the path-integrated
                  magnetic field experienced by the beam can be
                  extracted uniquely, as can the magnetic-energy
                  spectrum under a further statistical assumption of
                  isotropy. This is no longer the case in the caustic
                  or diffusive regimes. We also discuss complications
                  to the contrast-regime characterisation arising for
                  inhomogeneous, multi-scale stochastic fields, as
                  well as limitations currently placed by experimental
                  capabilities on extracting magnetic field
                  statistics. The results presented in this paper
                  provide a comprehensive description of proton images
                  of stochastic magnetic fields, with applications for
                  improved analysis of given proton-flux images.},

                  presence of mm to cm size "pebbles" in the outer
                  parts of disks around pre-main-sequence stars. The
                  observations suggest that large grains are produced
                  relatively early in disk evolution ({\textless} 1
                  Myr) and remain at large radii for longer periods of
                  time (5 to 10 Myr). Simple theoretical estimates of
                  the radial drift time of solid particles, however,
                  imply that they would drift inward over a time scale
                  of less than 0.1 Myr. In this paper, we address this
                  conflict between theory and observation, using more
                  detailed theoretical models, including the effects
                  of sedimentation, collective drag forces and
                  turbulent viscosity. We find that, although these
                  effects slow down the radial drift of the dust
                  particles, this reduction is not sufficient to
                  explain the observationally determined long survival
                  time of mm/cm-sized grains in protoplanetary
                  disks. However, if for some reason the gas to dust
                  ratio in the disk is reduced by at least a factor of
                  20 from the canonical value of 100 (for instance
                  through photoevaporation of the gas), then the
                  radial drift time scales become sufficiently large
                  to be in agreement with observations.},

                  (\${\textbackslash}alpha{\textbackslash}lesssim10{\textasciicircum}\{-4\}\$),
                  a super-Earth opens two annular gaps to either side

                  double gap and its associated gas pressure gradients
                  cause dust particles to be dragged by gas into three

                  two rings located at the gap edges farthest from the
                  planet. Depending on system parameters, additional
                  rings may manifest for a single planet. A double gap
                  located at tens of AUs from a host star in Taurus
                  can be detected in the dust continuum by the Atacama

                  resolution of {\textasciitilde}0".03 after two hours

                  thousands of orbits, and change their relative
                  positions and dimensions depending on the speed and
                  direction of planet migration. Candidate double gaps
                  have been observed by ALMA in systems like HL Tau
                  (D5 and D6) and TW Hya (at 37 and 43 AU); we submit

                  in protoplanetary disks. Various initial dust to gas

                  asymmetric transition discs with inner

                  planet-induced vortices have neglected the timescale
                  of hundreds to thousands of orbits to grow a massive
                  planet to Jupiter-size. In this work, we study the
                  effect of a giant planet's runaway growth timescale
                  on the lifetime and characteristics of the resulting
                  vortex. For two different planet masses (1 and 5
                  Jupiter masses) and two different disc viscosities
                  (\${\textbackslash}alpha\$=3\${\textbackslash}times

                  we compare the vortices induced by planets with
                  several different growth timescales between 10 and
                  4000 planet orbits. In general, we find that
                  slowly-growing planets create significantly weaker
                  vortices with lifetimes and surface densities
                  reduced by more than \$50{\textbackslash}\%\$. For
                  the higher disc viscosity, the longest growth
                  timescales in our study inhibit vortex formation
                  altogether. Additionally, slowly-growing planets
                  produce vortices that are up to twice as elongated,
                  with azimuthal extents well above
                  \$180{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\}\$ in

                  create a distinct signature in the dust observations

                  vortices that correspond to planets with faster
                  growth timescales. Lastly, we find that the low
                  viscosities necessary for vortex formation likely
                  prevent planets from growing quickly enough to

                  observations of the 1.3 mm continuum emission from
                  circumstellar disks around 11 low and intermediate
                  mass pre-main sequence stars. High resolution
                  observations for 3 additional sources were obtained
                  from literature. In all cases the disk emission is
                  spatially resolved. We adopt a self consistent
                  accretion disk model based on the similarity
                  solution for the disk surface density and constrain
                  the dust radial density distribution on spatial
                  scales of about 40 AU. Disk surface densities appear
                  to be correlated with the stellar ages where the
                  characteristic disk radius increases from
                  {\textasciitilde} 20 AU to 100 AU over about 5
                  Myr. This disk expansion is accompanied by a
                  decrease in the mass accretion rate, suggesting that
                  our sample disks form an evolutionary
                  sequence. Interpreting our results in terms of the
                  temporal evolution of a viscous
                  \${\textbackslash}alpha\$-disk, we estimate (i) that
                  at the beginning of the disk evolution about 60\% of
                  the circumstellar material was located inside radii
                  of 25--40 AU, (ii) that disks formed with masses
                  from 0.05 to 0.4 M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}sun\}\$ and
                  (iii) that the viscous timescale at the disk initial
                  radius is about 0.1-0.3 Myr. Viscous disk models
                  tightly link the surface density
                  \${\textbackslash}Sigma(R)\$ with the radial profile
                  of the disk viscosity \${\textbackslash}nu(R)
                  {\textbackslash}propto
                  R{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}gamma\}\$. We
                  find values of \${\textbackslash}gamma\$ ranging
                  from -0.8 to 0.8, suggesting that the viscosity
                  dependence on the orbital radius can be very
                  different in the observed disks. Adopting the
                  \${\textbackslash}alpha\$ parameterization for the
                  viscosity, we argue that \${\textbackslash}alpha\$
                  must decrease with the orbital radius and that it
                  may vary between 0.5 and
                  \$10{\textasciicircum}\{-4\}\$. (abridged)},

  abstract =	 {A number of transition disks exhibit significant
                  azimuthal asymmetries in thermal dust emission. One
                  possible origin for these asymmetries is dust
                  trapping in vortices formed at the edges of dead
                  zones. We carry out high-resolution, two-dimensional
                  hydrodynamic simulations of this scenario, including
                  the effects of dust feedback. We find that, although
                  feedback weakens the vortices and slows down the
                  process of dust accumulation, the dust distribution
                  in the disk can nonetheless remain asymmetric for
                  many thousands of orbits. We show that even after
                  \$10{\textasciicircum}4\$ orbits, or \$2.5\$ Myr
                  when scaled to the parameters of Oph IRS 48 (a
                  significant fraction of its age), the dust is not
                  dispersed into an axisymmetric ring, in contrast to
                  the case of a vortex formed by a planet. This is
                  because accumulation of mass at the dead zone edge
                  constantly replenishes the vortex, preventing it
                  from being fully destroyed. We produce synthetic
                  dust emission images using our simulation
                  results. We find that multiple small clumps of dust
                  may be distributed azimuthally. These clumps, if not
                  resolved from one another, appear as a single large
                  feature. A defining characteristic of a disk with a
                  dead zone edge is that an asymmetric feature is
                  accompanied by a ring of dust located about twice as
                  far from the central star.},

                  on a course given at the University of Cambridge in
                  Part III of the Mathematical Tripos. Fluid dynamics
                  is involved in a very wide range of astrophysical
                  phenomena, such as the formation and internal
                  dynamics of stars and giant planets, the workings of
                  jets and accretion discs around stars and black
                  holes, and the dynamics of the expanding
                  Universe. Effects that can be important in
                  astrophysical fluids include compressibility,
                  self-gravitation and the dynamical influence of the
                  magnetic field that is 'frozen in' to a highly
                  conducting plasma. The basic models introduced and
                  applied in this course are Newtonian gas dynamics
                  and magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) for an ideal
                  compressible fluid. The mathematical structure of
                  the governing equations and the associated
                  conservation laws are explored in some detail
                  because of their importance for both analytical and
                  numerical methods of solution, as well as for
                  physical interpretation. Linear and nonlinear waves,
                  including shocks and other discontinuities, are
                  discussed. The spherical blast wave resulting from a
                  supernova, and involving a strong shock, is a
                  classic problem that can be solved
                  analytically. Steady solutions with spherical or
                  axial symmetry reveal the physics of winds and jets
                  from stars and discs. The linearized equations
                  determine the oscillation modes of astrophysical
                  bodies, as well as determining their stability and
                  their response to tidal forcing.},

                  formation in terms of particle size and planetary
                  mass. We also monitor the amount of dust that is
                  accreted by the planet relative to the amount of
                  gas, which is an important parameter in determining
                  the enrichment of solids in giant planets compared
                  to the solid content of the central
                  star. Methods. We use a new two-fluid hydrodynamics
                  code to solve the flow equations for both gas and
                  dust. For the gas, we use a Godunov-type scheme with
                  an approximate Riemann solver (the Roe solver). The
                  dust is treated as a pressureless fluid by
                  essentially the same numerical method as is used for
                  the gas. Results. We find that it only takes a
                  planet of 0.05 Jupiter masses to open up a gap in a
                  disk with a significant population of mm-sized
                  particles. Dust particles larger than 150 µm
                  participate in gap formation. We also find that the
                  formation of the gap severely slows down dust
                  accretion compared to that in the gas. Therefore, it
                  is not possible to enrich a newly formed giant

                  non-axisymmetric brightness distributions with a
                  horseshoe-like morphology for more than a dozen
                  transition disks. The most accepted explanation for
                  the observed asymmetries is the accumulation of dust
                  in large-scale vortices. Protoplanetary disks
                  vortices can form by the excitation of Rossby-wave
                  instability in the vicinity of a steep pressure
                  gradient, which can develop at the edges of a giant
                  planet carved gap or at the edges of an
                  accretionally inactive zone. We studied the
                  formation and evolution of vortices formed in these
                  two distinct scenarios by means of two-dimensional
                  locally isothermal hydrodynamic simulations. We
                  found that the vortex formed at the edge of a
                  planetary gap is short-lived, unless the disk is
                  nearly inviscid. In contrast, the vortex formed at
                  the outer edge of a dead zone is long-lived. The
                  vortex morphology can be significantly different in
                  the two scenarios: the vortex radial and azimuthal
                  extensions are {\textasciitilde}1.5 and
                  {\textasciitilde}3.5 times larger for the dead zone
                  edge compared to gap models. In some particular
                  cases, the vortex aspect ratios can be similar in
                  the two scenarios, however, the vortex azimuthal
                  extensions can be used to distinguish the vortex
                  formation mechanisms. We calculate predictions for
                  vortex observability in the sub-millimeter continuum
                  with ALMA. We found that the azimuthal and radial
                  extent of brightness asymmetry correlates with
                  vortex formation process, within the limitations of
                  alpha-viscosity prescription.},

                  about 0.3 mJy), using the IRAM PdBI. With our high
                  detection rate of 17/19 we provide the first
                  detections at wavelengths longer than about 1 mm for

                  the mm SED slopes and dust properties of faint disks
                  and compare them to brighter disks using a uniform
                  analysis method. With these new data and literature
                  measurements at sub-millimeter and millimeter
                  wavelengths, we analyze the dust properties of a
                  sample of 21 isolated disks around T Tauri stars in
                  the Taurus-Auriga star forming region. Together with
                  the information about the disks' spatial extension
                  from sub/mm-mm interferometric studies, we derive
                  from the observed sub-mm/mm spectral energy
                  distribution constraints on the dust opacity law at
                  these wavelengths, using two-layer flared disk
                  models and a self-consistent dust model that
                  properly takes into account the variation of the
                  dust opacity with grain growth. We find evidence for
                  the presence of dust particles in the disk midplane
                  that have grown to sizes as large as at least 1
                  millimeter in all the disks of our sample,
                  confirming what was previously observed on smaller
                  brighter objects. This indicates that the dust
                  coagulation from ISM dust to mm-sized grains is a
                  very fast process in protoplanetary disks, which
                  appears to occur before a young stellar object
                  enters the class II evolutionary stage. The amount
                  of these large grains in the disk outer regions is
                  also found to be stationary throughout the whole
                  class II evolutionary stage, which indicates that
                  mechanisms slowing down the dust inward migration
                  play an important role in the Taurus-Auriga
                  protoplanetary disks. Another result is that the
                  spectral index between 1 and 3 mm for the six
                  faintest disks in our sample is on average smaller
                  than for the brighter disks, indicating either that
                  these fainter yet unmapped disks are spatially much
                  less extended than the brighter spatially resolved
                  disks, or that fainter disks have typically larger
                  dust grains in their outer regions. Considering that
                  these fainter disks are more representative of the
                  bulk of the disk population than the brighter ones,
                  this may have important consequences for the
                  theories of planetesimal formation and disk
                  formation and evolution. Finally, we investigate the
                  relations between the derived dust properties,
                  namely dust mass and grain growth, and the
                  properties of the central star, like its mass, age
                  and mass accretion rate.},

                  substructures in nearby young disks which are due to
                  the gravitational interaction between disk material
                  and planets close to the central star. We simulate
                  the gas and dust dynamics in the disk using the
                  LA-COMPASS hydrodynamical code. We generate
                  synthetic images for the dust continuum emission at
                  sub-millimeter to centimeter wavelengths and
                  simulate ALMA and ngVLA observations. We explore the
                  parameter space of some of the main disk and planet
                  properties that would produce substructures that can
                  be visible with ALMA and the ngVLA. We find that

                  \${\textbackslash}approx 5 - 10

  abstract =	 {Large-scale persistent vortices could play a key
                  role in the evolution of protoplanetary disks,
                  particularly in the dead zone where no turbulence
                  associated with a magnetic field is expected. These
                  vortices are known to form easily in 2D disks via
                  the Rossby wave or the baroclinic instability. In
                  three dimensions, however, their formation and
                  stability is a complex problem and still a matter of
                  debate. We study the formation of vortices by the
                  Rossby wave instability in a stratified inviscid
                  disk and describe their 3D structure, stability, and
                  long-term evolution. Numerical simulations were
                  performed using a fully compressible hydrodynamical
                  code based on a second-order finite volume
                  method. We assumed a perfect-gas law and a
                  non-homentropic adiabatic flow. The Rossby wave
                  instability is found to proceed in 3D in a
                  similarway as in 2D. Vortices produced by the
                  instability look like columns of vorticity in the
                  whole disk thickness; the weak vertical motions are
                  related to the weak inclination of the vortex axis
                  that appears during the development of the
                  RWI. Vortices with aspect ratios higher than 6 are
                  unaffected by the elliptical instability. They relax
                  into a quasi-steady columnar structure that survives
                  hundreds of rotations while slowly migrating inward
                  toward the star at a rate that reduces with the
                  vortex aspect ratio. Vortices with a lower aspect
                  ratio are by contrast affected by the elliptic
                  instability. Short aspect ratio vortices (χ
                  {\textless} 4) are completely destroyed in a few
                  orbital periods. Vortices with an intermediate
                  aspect ratio (4 {\textless} χ {\textless} 6) are
                  partially destroyed by the elliptical instability in
                  a region away from the midplane where the disk
                  stratification is sufficiently strong. Elongated
                  Rossby vortices can survive many orbital periods in
                  protoplanetary disks in the form of vorticity
                  columns. They could play a significant role in the
                  evolution of the gas and the gathering of solid
                  particles to form planetesimals or planetary cores,
                  a possibility that receives a renewed interest with
                  the recent discovery of a particle trap in the disk
                  of Oph IRS 48.},

                  assessment, as well as an ultrasound
                  examination. Tongue motility was mildly reduced as a
                  result of tissue scarring. Speech was rated to be
                  fully intelligible and highly acceptable by 4
                  raters, although 2 raters noticed slight distortions
                  of the sibilants /s/ and /z/. The 3-dimensional
                  ultrasound demonstrated that the synergy of the 2
                  sides of the tongue was preserved. A notably deep
                  posterior genioglossus furrow indicated compensation
                  for the reduced length of the tongue blade. It is

  abstract =	 {The gravitational-wave signal GW190521 is consistent
                  with a binary black hole (BBH) merger source at
                  redshift 0.8 with unusually high component masses, M
                  ⊙ and M ⊙, compared to previously reported events,
                  and shows mild evidence for spin-induced orbital
                  precession. The primary falls in the mass gap
                  predicted by (pulsational) pair-instability
                  supernova theory, in the approximate range 65–120 M
                  ⊙. The probability that at least one of the black
                  holes in GW190521 is in that range is 99.0\%. The
                  final mass of the merger ( M ⊙) classifies it as an
                  intermediate-mass black hole. Under the assumption
                  of a quasi-circular BBH coalescence, we detail the
                  physical properties of GW190521’s source binary and
                  its post-merger remnant, including component masses
                  and spin vectors. Three different waveform models,
                  as well as direct comparison to numerical solutions
                  of general relativity, yield consistent estimates of
                  these properties. Tests of strong-field general
                  relativity targeting the merger-ringdown stages of
                  the coalescence indicate consistency of the observed
                  signal with theoretical predictions. We estimate the
                  merger rate of similar systems to be . We discuss
                  the astrophysical implications of GW190521 for
                  stellar collapse and for the possible formation of
                  black holes in the pair-instability mass gap through
                  various channels: via (multiple) stellar
                  coalescences, or via hierarchical mergers of
                  lower-mass black holes in star clusters or in active
                  galactic nuclei. We find it to be unlikely that
                  GW190521 is a strongly lensed signal of a lower-mass
                  black hole binary merger. We also discuss more
                  exotic possible sources for GW190521, including a
                  highly eccentric black hole binary, or a primordial
                  black hole binary.},

  abstract =	 {We investigate the origins of Kepler-419, a peculiar
                  system hosting two nearly coplanar and highly
                  eccentric gas giants with apsidal orientations
                  liberating around anti-alignment, and use this
                  system to place constraints on the properties of
                  their birth protoplanetary disc.  We follow the
                  proposal by Petrovich, Wu, \& Ali-Dib that these
                  planets have been placed on these orbits as a
                  natural result of the precessional effects of a
                  dissipating massive disc and extend it by using
                  direct N-body simulations and models for the
                  evolution of the gas discs, including
                  photoevaporation. Based on a parameter space
                  exploration, we find that in order to reproduce the
                  system the initial disc mass had to be at least 95
                  MJup and dissipate on a time-scale of at least 104
                  yr. This mass is consistent with the upper end of
                  the observed disc masses distribution, and the
                  dissipation time-scale is consistent with
                  photoevaporation models. We study the properties of
                  such discs using simplified 1D thin-disc models and
                  show that they are gravitationally stable,
                  indicating that the two planets must have formed via
                  core accretion and thus prone to disc migration. We
                  hence finally investigate the sensitivity of this
                  mechanism to the outer planet's semimajor axis, and
                  find that the nearby 7:1, 8:1, and 9:1 mean-motion
                  resonances can completely quench this mechanism,
                  while even higher order resonances can also
                  significantly affect the system. Assuming the two
                  planets avoid these high-order resonances and close
                  encounters, the dynamics seems to be rather
                  insensitive to planet c semimajor axis, and thus
                  orbital migration driven by the disc.},

  abstract =	 {We introduce the Disk Substructures at High Angular
                  Resolution Project (DSHARP), one of the initial
                  Large Programs conducted with the Atacama Large
                  Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). The primary
                  goal of DSHARP is to ﬁnd and characterize
                  substructures in the spatial distributions of solid
                  particles for a sample of 20 nearby protoplanetary
                  disks, using very high resolution (∼0. 035, or 5 au,
                  FWHM) observations of their 240 GHz (1.25 mm)
                  continuum emission. These data provide a ﬁrst
                  homogeneous look at the small-scale features in
                  disks that are directly relevant to the planet
                  formation process, quantifying their prevalence,
                  morphologies, spatial scales, spacings, symmetry,
                  and amplitudes, for targets with a variety of disk
                  and stellar host properties. We ﬁnd that these
                  substructures are ubiquitous in this sample of
                  large, bright disks. They are most frequently
                  manifested as concentric, narrow emission rings and
                  depleted gaps, although large-scale spiral patterns
                  and small arc-shaped azimuthal asymmetries are also
                  present in some cases. These substructures are found
                  at a wide range of disk radii (from a few au to more
                  than 100 au), are usually compact ( 10 au), and show
                  a wide range of amplitudes (brightness
                  contrasts). Here we discuss the motivation for the
                  project, describe the survey design and the sample
                  properties, detail the observations and data
                  calibration, highlight some basic results, and
                  provide a general overview of the key conclusions
                  that are presented in more detail in a series of
                  accompanying articles. The DSHARP data – including

                  reflect the underlying mechanisms that drive those
                  formation processes. Observations of the solids and
                  gas in these disks, particularly at high resolution,
                  provide fundamental insights on their mass
                  distributions, dynamical states, and evolutionary
                  behaviors. Over the past decade, rapid developments
                  in these areas have largely been driven by
                  observations with the Atacama Large
                  Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). This review
                  highlights the state of observational research on
                  disk structures, emphasizing three key conclusions
                  that reflect the main branches of the field: (1)
                  Relationships among disk structure properties are
                  also linked to the masses, environments, and
                  evolutionary states of their stellar hosts; (2)
                  There is clear, qualitative evidence for the growth
                  and migration of disk solids, although the implied
                  evolutionary timescales suggest the classical
                  assumption of a smooth gas disk is inappropriate;
                  and (3) Small-scale substructures with a variety of
                  morphologies, locations, scales, and amplitudes --
                  presumably tracing local gas pressure maxima --
                  broadly influence the physical and observational
                  properties of disks. The last point especially is
                  reshaping the field, with the recognition that these
                  disk substructures likely trace active sites of
                  planetesimal growth or are the hallmarks of
                  planetary systems at their formation epoch.},

  abstract =	 {Aims: Many extrasolar systems possessing planets in
                  mean-motion resonance or resonant chain have been
                  discovered to date. The transit method coupled with
                  transit timing variation analysis provides an
                  insight into the physical and orbital parameters of
                  the systems, but suffers from observational
                  limitations. When a (near-)resonant planetary system
                  resides in the dynamical neighbourhood of a stable
                  periodic orbit, its long-term stability, and thus
                  survival, can be guaranteed. We use the intrinsic
                  property of the periodic orbits, namely their linear
                  horizontal and vertical stability, to validate or
                  further constrain the orbital elements of detected
                  two-planet systems. Methods: We computed the
                  families of periodic orbits in the general
                  three-body problem for several two-planet Kepler and
                  K2 systems. The dynamical neighbourhood of the
                  systems is unveiled with maps of dynamical
                  stability. Results: Additional validations or
                  constraints on the orbital elements of K2-21, K2-24,
                  Kepler-9, and (non-coplanar) Kepler-108
                  near-resonant systems were achieved. While a
                  mean-motion resonance locking protects the long-term
                  evolution of the systems K2-21 and K2-24, such a
                  resonant evolution is not possible for the Kepler-9
                  system, whose stability is maintained through an
                  apsidal anti-alignment. For the Kepler-108 system,
                  we find that the stability of its mutually inclined
                  planets could be justified either solely by a
                  mean-motion resonance, or in tandem with an
                  inclination-type resonance. Going forward, dynamical
                  analyses based on periodic orbits could yield better
                  constrained orbital elements of near-resonant
                  extrasolar systems when performed in parallel to the
                  fitting of the observational data.},

                  resonant chain?},
  url =		 {http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.08612},
  abstract =	 {The orbital distribution of exoplanets indicates an
                  accumulation of compact Super-Earth sized planetary
                  systems close to their host stars. Assuming an
                  inward disc-driven migration scenario for their
                  formation, these planets could have been stopped and
                  eventually parked at an inner edge of the disc, or
                  be pushed through the inner disc cavity by a
                  resonant chain. This topic has not been properly and
                  extensively studied. Using numerical simulations we
                  investigate how much the inner planets in a resonant
                  chain can be pushed into the disc inner cavity by
                  outer planets. We perform hydrodynamical and N-body
                  simulations of planetary systems embedded in their
                  nascent disc. The inner edge of the disc is
                  represented in two different ways, resembling either
                  a dead zone (DZ) inner edge or a disc inner boundary
                  (IB), where the main difference lies in the
                  steepness of the surface density profile. The
                  innermost planet has always a mass of 10 M\_Earth,
                  with equal or higher mass additional outer
                  planets. A steeper profile is able to stop a chain
                  of planets more efficiently than a shallower
                  profile. The final configurations in our DZ models
                  are usually tighter than in their IB counterparts,
                  and therefore more prone to instability. We derive
                  analytical expressions for the stopping conditions
                  based on power equilibrium, and show that the final
                  eccentricities result from torque equilibrium. For
                  planets in thinner discs, we found, for the first
                  time, clear signs for overstable librations in the
                  hydrodynamical simulations, leading to very compact
                  systems. We also found that the popular N-body
                  simulations may overestimate the number of planets
                  in the disc inner cavity.},

  abstract =	 {The most accurate method for modelling planetary
                  migration and hence the formation of resonant
                  systems is using hydrodynamical
                  simulations. Usually, the force (torque) acting on a
                  planet is calculated using the forces from the gas
                  disc and the star, while the gas accelerations are
                  computed using the pressure gradient, the star, and
                  the planet's gravity, ignoring its own gravity. For
                  the non-migrating the neglect of the disc gravity
                  results in a consistent torque calculation while for
                  the migrating case it is inconsistent. We aim to
                  study how much this inconsistent torque calculation
                  can affect the final configuration of a two-planet
                  system. Our focus will be on low-mass planets
                  because most of the multi-planetary systems,
                  discovered by the Kepler survey, have masses around
                  10 Earth masses. Performing hydrodynamical
                  simulations of planet-disc interaction, we measure
                  the torques on non-migrating and migrating planets
                  for various disc masses as well as density and
                  temperature slopes with and without considering the
                  disc self-gravity. Using this data, we find a
                  relation that quantifies the inconsistency, use it
                  in an N-body code, and perform an extended parameter
                  study modelling the migration of a planetary system
                  with different planet mass ratios and disc surface
                  densities, in order to investigate the impact of the
                  torque inconsistency on the architecture of the
                  planetary system. Not considering disc self-gravity
                  produces an artificially larger torque on the
                  migrating planet that can result in tighter
                  planetary systems. The deviation of this torque from
                  the correct value is larger in discs with steeper
                  surface density profiles. In hydrodynamical
                  modelling of multi-planetary systems, it is crucial
                  to account for the torque correction, otherwise the
                  results favour more packed systems.},

  abstract =	 {Combining hydrodynamic planet-disk interaction
                  simulations with dust evolution models, we show that
                  protoplanetary disks having a giant planet can
                  reveal diverse morphology in (sub-)millimeter
                  continuum, including a full disk without significant
                  radial structure, a transition disk with an inner
                  cavity, a disk with a single gap and a central
                  continuum peak, and a disk with multiple rings and
                  gaps. Such a diversity originates from (1) the level
                  of viscous transport in the disk which determines
                  the number of gaps a planet can open; (2) the size
                  and spatial distributions of grains determined by
                  the coagulation, fragmentation, and radial drift,
                  which in turn affects the emmisivity of the disk at
                  (sub-)millimeter wavelengths; and (3) the angular
                  resolution used to observe the disk. In particular,
                  our results show that disks having the same
                  underlying gas distribution can have very different
                  grain size/spatial distributions and thus appearance
                  in continuum, depending on the interplay among
                  coagulation, fragmentation, and radial drift. This
                  suggests that proper treatments for the grain growth
                  have to be included in models of protoplanetary
                  disks concerning continuum properties and that
                  complementary molecular line observations are highly
                  desired in addition to continuum observations to
                  reveal the true nature of disks. The fact that a
                  single planet can produce diverse disk morphology
                  emphasizes the need to search for more direct,
                  localized signatures of planets in order to confirm
                  (or dispute) the planetary origin of observed ringed

  abstract =	 {As spiral waves driven by a planet in a gaseous disk
                  steepen into a shock, they deposit angular momentum,
                  opening a gap in the disk. This has been well
                  studied using both linear theory and numerical
                  simulations, but so far, only for the primary spiral
                  arm -- the one directly attached to the
                  planet. Using two-dimensional hydrodynamic
                  simulations, we show that the secondary and tertiary
                  arms driven by a planet can also open gaps as they
                  steepen into shocks. The depths of the
                  secondary/tertiary gaps in surface density grow with
                  time in a low viscosity disk
                  (\${\textbackslash}alpha =
                  5{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{-5\}\$),
                  so even low-mass planets (e.g., super-Earth or
                  mini-Neptune-mass) embedded in the disk can open
                  multiple observable gaps, provided that sufficient
                  time has passed. Applying our results to the HL Tau
                  disk, we show that a single 30 Earth-mass planet
                  embedded in the ring at 68.8{\textasciitilde}au (B5)
                  can reasonably well reproduce the positions of the
                  two major gaps at 13.2 and 32.3 au (D1 and D2), and
                  roughly reproduce two other major gaps at 64.2 and
                  74.7 au (D5 and D6) seen in the mm continuum. The
                  positions of secondary/tertiary gaps are found to be
                  sensitive to the planetary mass and the disk
                  temperature profile, so with accurate observational
                  measurements of the temperature structure the
                  positions of multiple gaps can be used to constrain
                  the mass of the planet. We also comment on the gaps
                  seen in the TW Hya and HD{\textasciitilde}163296

  abstract =	 {Protoplanetary disk simulations show that a single
                  planet can excite more than one spiral arm, possibly
                  explaining recent observations of multiple spiral
                  arms in some systems. In this paper, we explain the
                  mechanism by which a planet excites multiple spiral
                  arms in a protoplanetary disk. Contrary to previous
                  speculations, the formation of both primary and
                  additional arms can be understood as a linear
                  process when the planet mass is sufficiently
                  small. A planet resonantly interacts with epicyclic
                  oscillations in the disk, launching spiral wave
                  modes around the Lindblad resonances. When a set of
                  wave modes is in phase, they can constructively
                  interfere with each other and create a spiral
                  arm. More than one spiral arm can form because such
                  constructive interference can occur for different
                  sets of wave modes, with the exact number and
                  launching position of spiral arms dependent on the
                  planet mass as well as the disk temperature
                  profile. Non-linear effects become increasingly
                  important as the planet mass increases, resulting in
                  spiral arms with stronger shocks and thus larger
                  pitch angles. This is found in common for both
                  primary and additional arms. When a planet has a
                  sufficiently large mass (\${\textbackslash}gtrsim\$
                  3 thermal masses for \$(h/r)\_p=0.1\$), only two
                  spiral arms form interior to its orbit. The wave
                  modes that would form a tertiary arm for smaller
                  mass planets merge with the primary
                  arm. Improvements in our understanding of the
                  formation of spiral arms can provide crucial
                  insights into the origin of observed spiral arms in
                  protoplanetary disks.},

                  the masses of unseen planets and their positions
                  within their disks. By carrying out two-dimensional
                  hydrodynamic simulations varying planet mass and
                  disk gas temperature, we find that a larger number
                  of spiral arms form with a smaller planet mass and a
                  lower disk temperature. A planet excites two or more
                  spiral arms interior to its orbit for a range of
                  disk temperature characterized by the disk aspect
                  ratio
                  \$0.04{\textbackslash}leq(h/r)\_p{\textbackslash}leq0.15\$,
                  whereas exterior to a planet's orbit multiple spiral
                  arms can form only in cold disks with \$(h/r)\_p
                  {\textbackslash}lesssim 0.06\$. Constraining the
                  planet mass with the pitch angle of spiral arms
                  requires accurate disk temperature measurements that
                  might be challenging even with ALMA. However, the
                  property that the pitch angle of planet-driven
                  spiral arms decreases away from the planet can be a
                  powerful diagnostic to determine whether the planet
                  is located interior or exterior to the observed
                  spirals. The arm-to-arm separations increase as a
                  function of planet mass, consistent with previous
                  studies; however, the exact slope depends on disk
                  temperature as well as the radial location where the
                  arm-to-arm separations are measured. We apply these
                  diagnostics to the spiral arms seen in MWC 758 and
                  Elias 2-27. As shown in Bae et al. (2017),
                  planet-driven spiral arms can create concentric
                  rings and gaps, which can produce more dominant
                  observable signature than spiral arms under certain
                  circumstances. We discuss the observability of
                  planet-driven spiral arms versus rings and gaps.},

                  planets that reside in or near mean-motion
                  resonances are relatively common. While the origin
                  of such systems is attributed to protoplanetary
                  disk-driven migration, a qualitative description of
                  the dynamical evolution of resonant planets remains
                  largely elusive. Aided by the pioneering works of
                  the last century, we formulate an approximate,
                  integrable theory for ﬁrst-order resonant motion. We
                  utilize the developed theory to construct an
                  intuitive, geometrical representation of resonances
                  within the context of the unrestricted three-body

                  criterion for the appearance of secondary resonances
                  between resonant and secular motion. Subsequently,

                  slow chaos as a result of secular modulation of the

                  systems are often shaped by dissipative processes
                  that drive orbital migration. In multi-planet
                  systems, convergent amassing of orbits inevitably
                  leads to encounters with rational period ratios,
                  which may result in establishment of mean motion
                  resonances. The success or failure of resonant
                  capture yields exceedingly different subsequent
                  evolutions, and thus plays a central role in
                  determining the ensuing orbital architecture of
                  planetary systems. In this work, we employ an
                  integrable Hamiltonian formalism for first order
                  planetary resonances that allows both secondary
                  bodies to have finite masses and eccentricities, and
                  construct a comprehensive theory for resonant
                  capture. Particularly, we derive conditions under
                  which orbital evolution lies within the adiabatic
                  regime, and provide a generalized criterion for
                  guaranteed resonant locking as well as a procedure
                  for calculating capture probabilities when capture
                  is not certain. Subsequently, we utilize the
                  developed analytical model to examine the evolution
                  of Jupiter and Saturn within the protosolar nebula,
                  and investigate the origins of the dominantly
                  non-resonant orbital distribution of sub-Jovian
                  extrasolar planets. Our calculations show that the
                  commonly observed extrasolar orbital structure can
                  be understood if planet pairs encounter mean motion
                  commensurabilities on slightly eccentric
                  (e{\textasciitilde}0.02) orbits. Accordingly, we
                  speculate that resonant capture among low-mass
                  planets is typically rendered unsuccessful due to
                  subtle axial asymmetries inherent to the global

                  within the scattered disk population of the Kuiper
                  Belt exhibit an unexpected clustering in their
                  respective arguments of perihelion. While several
                  hypotheses have been put forward to explain this
                  alignment, to date, a theoretical model that can
                  successfully account for the observations remains
                  elusive. In this work we show that the orbits of
                  distant Kuiper Belt objects (KBOs) cluster not only
                  in argument of perihelion, but also in physical
                  space. We demonstrate that the perihelion positions
                  and orbital planes of the objects are tightly
                  confined and that such a clustering has only a
                  probability of 0.007\% to be due to chance, thus
                  requiring a dynamical origin. We find that the
                  observed orbital alignment can be maintained by a
                  distant eccentric planet with mass ≳10 m ⊕ whose
                  orbit lies in approximately the same plane as those
                  of the distant KBOs, but whose perihelion is 180°
                  away from the perihelia of the minor bodies. In
                  addition to accounting for the observed orbital
                  alignment, the existence of such a planet naturally
                  explains the presence of high-perihelion Sedna-like
                  objects, as well as the known collection of high
                  semimajor axis objects with inclinations between 60°
                  and 150° whose origin was previously
                  unclear. Continued analysis of both distant and
                  highly inclined outer solar system objects provides
                  the opportunity for testing our hypothesis as well
                  as further constraining the orbital elements and

                  rare circumtriple disk. We present Atacama Large
                  Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations
                  of 1.3 mm dust continuum and 12CO J=2-1 molecular
                  gas emission of the disk. For the first time, we
                  identify three dust rings in the disk at
                  {\textasciitilde}46, 188, and 338 AU, with estimated
                  dust mass of {\textasciitilde}70-250 Earth mass,
                  respectively. To our knowledge, the outer ring in GW
                  Ori is the largest dust ring ever found in
                  protoplanetary disks. We use visibility modelling of
                  dust continuum to show that the disk has misaligned
                  parts and the innermost dust ring is eccentric. The
                  disk misalignment is also suggested by the CO
                  kinematics modelling. We interpret these
                  substructures as evidence of ongoing dynamical
                  interactions between the triple stars and the

                  Project (DSHARP) is the largest homogeneous
                  high-resolution (∼0 035, or ∼5 au) disk continuum
                  imaging survey with the Atacama Large
                  Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) so far. In the
                  coming years, many more disks will be mapped with
                  ALMA at similar resolution. Interpreting the results
                  in terms of the properties and quantities of the
                  emitting dusty material is, however, a very
                  non-trivial task. This is in part due to the
                  uncertainty in the dust opacities, an uncertainty
                  that is not likely to be resolved any time soon. It
                  is also partly due to the fact that, as the DSHARP
                  survey has shown, these disk often contain regions
                  of intermediate to high optical depth, even at
                  millimeter wavelengths and at relatively large
                  radius in the disk. This makes the interpretation
                  challenging, in particular if the grains are large
                  and have a large albedo. On the other hand, the
                  highly structured features seen in the DSHARP
                  survey, of which strong indications were already
                  seen in earlier observations, provide a unique
                  opportunity to study the dust growth and
                  dynamics. To provide continuity within the DSHARP
                  project, its follow-up projects, and projects by
                  other teams interested in these data, we present
                  here the methods and opacity choices used within the
                  DSHARP collaboration to link the measured intensity

                  evolution of dust in protoplanetary disks generally
                  oversimplify either the radial evolution of the disk
                  (by focussing at one single radius or by using
                  steady state disk models) or they assume particle
                  growth to proceed monodispersely or without
                  fragmentation. Further studies of protoplanetary
                  disks - such as observations, disk chemistry and
                  structure calculations or planet population
                  synthesis models - depend on the distribution of
                  dust as a function of grain size and radial position
                  in the disk. Aims: We attempt to improve upon
                  current models to be able to investigate how the
                  initial conditions, the build-up phase, and the
                  evolution of the protoplanetary disk influence
                  growth and transport of dust. Methods: We introduce
                  a new model similar to Brauer et al. (2008, A\&A,
                  480, 859) in which we now include the time-dependent
                  viscous evolution of the gas disk, and in which more
                  advanced input physics and numerical integration
                  methods are implemented. Results: We show that grain
                  properties, the gas pressure gradient, and the
                  amount of turbulence are much more influencing the
                  evolution of dust than the initial conditions or the
                  build-up phase of the protoplanetary disk. We
                  quantify which conditions or environments are
                  favorable for growth beyond the meter size
                  barrier. High gas surface densities or zonal flows
                  may help to overcome the problem of radial drift,
                  however already a small amount of turbulence poses a

                  formation of larger bodies, such as
                  planetesimals. Aims: We aim to derive simple
                  equations that explain the global evolution of the
                  dust surface density profile and the upper limit of
                  the grain size distribution and which can readily be
                  used for further modeling or for interpreting of
                  observational data. Methods: We have developed a
                  simple model that follows the upper end of the dust
                  size distribution and the evolution of the dust
                  surface density profile. This model is calibrated
                  with state-of-the-art simulations of dust evolution,
                  which treat dust growth, fragmentation, and
                  transport in viscously evolving gas disks. Results:
                  We find very good agreement between the full
                  dust-evolution code and the toy model presented in
                  this paper. We derive analytical profiles that
                  describe the dust-to-gas ratios and the dust surface
                  density profiles well in protoplanetary disks, as
                  well as the radial flux by solid material "rain
                  out", which is crucial for triggering any gravity
                  assisted formation of planetesimals. We show that
                  fragmentation is the dominating effect in the inner
                  regions of the disk leading to a dust surface
                  density exponent of -1.5, while the outer regions at
                  later times can become drift-dominated, yielding a
                  dust surface density exponent of -0.75. Our results
                  show that radial drift is not efficient in
                  fragmenting dust grains. This supports the theory
                  that small dust grains are resupplied by
                  fragmentation due to the turbulent state of the

                  flux levels can only be reached by a reduction of
                  the dust mass by a factor of a few up to about 30
                  while keeping the gas mass of the disk the

                  clump formation. A suite of models using the
                  \${\textbackslash}beta\$ cooling approximation is
                  presented here. The initial disks have masses of
                  0.091 \$M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ and extend from 4
                  to 20 AU around a 1 \$M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$
                  protostar. The initial minimum Toomre \$Q\_i\$
                  values range from 1.3 to 2.7, while
                  \${\textbackslash}beta\$ ranges from 1 to 100. We
                  show that the choice of \$Q\_i\$ is equal in
                  importance to the \${\textbackslash}beta\$ value
                  assumed: high \$Q\_i\$ disks can be stable for small
                  \${\textbackslash}beta\$, when the initial disk
                  temperature is taken as a lower bound, while low
                  \$Q\_i\$ disks can fragment for high
                  \${\textbackslash}beta\$. These results imply that
                  the evolution of disks toward low \$Q\_i\$ must be
                  taken into account in assessing disk fragmentation
                  possibilities, at least in the inner disk, i.e.,
                  inside about 20 AU. The models suggest that if low
                  \$Q\_i\$ disks can form, there should be an as yet
                  largely undetected population of gas giants orbiting
                  G dwarfs between about 6 AU and 16 AU.},

                  instability may be responsible for the formation of
                  at least some gas giant exoplanets, particularly
                  massive or distant gas giants. With regard to
                  close-in gas giants, Boss (2017) used the β cooling
                  approximation to calculate hydrodynamical models of
                  inner gas disk instability, ﬁnding that provided
                  disks with low values of the initial minimum Toomre
                  stability parameter (i.e., Qi {\textless} 2 inside
                  20 au) form, fragmentation into self-gravitating
                  clumps could occur even for β as high as 100 (i.e.,
                  extremely slow cooling). Those results implied that
                  the evolution of disks toward low Qi must be taken
                  into account. This paper presents such models:
                  initial disk masses of 0.091 M⊙ extending from 4 to
                  20 au around a 1 M⊙ protostar, with a range (1 to
                  100) of β cooling parameters, the same as in Boss
                  (2017), but with all the disks starting with Qi =
                  2.7, i.e., gravitationally stable, and allowed to
                  cool from their initial outer disk temperature of
                  180 K to as low as 40 K. All the disks eventually
                  fragment into at least one dense clump. The clumps
                  were again replaced by virtual protoplanets (VPs)
                  and the masses and orbits of the resulting ensemble
                  of VPs compare favorably with those of Boss (2017),
                  supporting the claim that disk instability can form
                  gas giants rapidly inside 20 au, provided that
                  suﬃciently massive protoplanetary disks exist.},

  abstract =	 {Recent laser-plasma experiments report the existence
                  of dynamically significant magnetic fields, whose
                  statistical characterisation is essential for
                  understanding the physical processes these
                  experiments are attempting to investigate. In this
                  paper, we show how a proton imaging diagnostic can
                  be used to determine a range of relevant magnetic
                  field statistics, including the magnetic-energy
                  spectrum. To achieve this goal, we explore the
                  properties of an analytic relation between a
                  stochastic magnetic field and the image-flux
                  distribution created upon imaging that field. We
                  conclude that features of the beam's final
                  image-flux distribution often display a universal
                  character determined by a single, field-scale
                  dependent parameter - the contrast parameter - which
                  quantifies the relative size of the correlation
                  length of the stochastic field, proton displacements
                  due to magnetic deflections, and the image
                  magnification. For stochastic magnetic fields, we
                  establish the existence of four contrast regimes -
                  linear, nonlinear injective, caustic and diffusive -
                  under which proton-flux images relate to their
                  parent fields in a qualitatively distinct manner. As
                  a consequence, it is demonstrated that in the linear
                  or nonlinear injective regimes, the path-integrated
                  magnetic field experienced by the beam can be
                  extracted uniquely, as can the magnetic-energy
                  spectrum under a further statistical assumption of
                  isotropy. This is no longer the case in the caustic
                  or diffusive regimes. We also discuss complications
                  to the contrast-regime characterisation arising for
                  inhomogeneous, multi-scale stochastic fields, as
                  well as limitations currently placed by experimental
                  capabilities on extracting magnetic field
                  statistics. The results presented in this paper
                  provide a comprehensive description of proton images
                  of stochastic magnetic fields, with applications for
                  improved analysis of given proton-flux images.},

  abstract =	 {The growth of solid particles towards meter sizes in
                  protoplanetary disks has to circumvent at least two
                  hurdles, namely the rapid loss of material due to
                  radial drift and particle fragmentation due to
                  destructive collisions. In this paper, we present
                  the results of numerical simulations with more and
                  more realistic physics involved.  Step by step, we
                  include various effects, such as particle growth,
                  radial/vertical particle motion and dust particle
                  fragmentation in our simulations. We demonstrate
                  that the initial dust-to-gas ratio is essential for
                  the particles to overcome the radial drift
                  barrier. If this value is increased by a factor of 2
                  compared with the canonical value for the
                  interstellar medium, km-sized bodies can form in the
                  inner disk ({\textless}2 AU) within 104
                  yrs. However, we find that solid particles get
                  destroyed through collisional fragmentation. Only
                  with the unrealistically high-threshold velocities
                  needed for fragmentation to occur ({\textgreater}30
                  m/s), particles are able to grow to larger sizes in
                  disks with low α values. We also find that less than
                  5\% of the small dust grains remain in the disk
                  after 1 Myr due to radial drift, no matter whether
                  fragmentation is included in the simulations or
                  not. In this paper, we also present considerable
                  improvements to existing algorithms for
                  dust-particle coagulation, which speed up the
                  coagulation scheme by a factor of {\textasciitilde}

                  all reasonable values of the albedo it is certain to
                  be larger than Pluto. Prediscovery observations back
                  to 1989 are used to obtain an orbit with extremely
                  small errors. The object is currently at aphelion in
                  what appears to be a typical orbit for a scattered
                  Kuiper Belt object, except that it is inclined by
                  about 44° from the ecliptic. The presence of such a
                  large object at this extreme inclination suggests
                  that high-inclination Kuiper Belt objects formed
                  preferentially closer to the Sun. Observations from
                  Gemini Observatory show that the infrared spectrum
                  is, like that of Pluto and 2005 FY9, dominated by

                  color. 2003 UB313 is likely to undergo substantial
                  seasonal change over the large range of heliocentric
                  distances that it travels; at its current distance,
                  Pluto is likely to prove a useful analog for better
                  understanding the range of seasonal changes on this

                  planets to constrain formation and migration
                  scenarios for this population. We consistently refit
                  published RV data sets for 65 stars and find nine
                  systems with statistically significant trends
                  indicating the presence of an outer companion. We
                  combine these RV data with AO images to constrain
                  the masses and semi-major axes of these
                  companions. We quantify our sensitivity to the

                  analogs are more common around stars hosting

                  gas giants does not suppress the formation of inner
                  super-Earths, and that these two populations of
                  planets instead appear to be correlated. We also
                  find that the stellar metallicities of systems with
                  gas giant companions are higher than those without
                  companions, in agreement with the well-established

                  \${\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{11\}
                  M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, the theory faces a
                  number of challenges. For example, the observed
                  cores of many dark-matter dominated galaxies are
                  both less dense and less cuspy than naively
                  predicted in \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM. The
                  number of small galaxies and dwarf satellites in the
                  Local Group is also far below the predicted count of
                  low-mass dark matter halos and subhalos within
                  similar volumes. These issues underlie the most
                  well-documented problems with
                  \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM: Cusp/Core, Missing
                  Satellites, and Too-Big-to-Fail. The key question is
                  whether a better understanding of baryon physics,
                  dark matter physics, or both will be required to
                  meet these challenges. Other anomalies, including
                  the observed planar and orbital configurations of
                  Local Group satellites and the tight baryonic/dark
                  matter scaling relations obeyed by the galaxy
                  population, have been less thoroughly explored in
                  the context of \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM
                  theory. Future surveys to discover faint, distant
                  dwarf galaxies and to precisely measure their masses

                  testing possible solutions to the small-scale
                  challenges going forward. Observational programs to
                  constrain or discover and characterize the number of
                  truly dark low-mass halos are among the most
                  important, and achievable, goals in this field over
                  then next decade. These efforts will either further
                  verify the \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM paradigm or
                  demand a substantial revision in our understanding

  abstract =	 {Recent years have seen growing interest in the
                  streaming instability as a candidate mechanism to
                  produce planetesimals. However, these investigations
                  have been limited to small-scale simulations. We now
                  present the results of a global protoplanetary disk
                  evolution model that incorporates planetesimal
                  formation by the streaming instability, along with
                  viscous accretion, photoevaporation by EUV, FUV, and
                  X-ray photons, dust evolution, the water ice line,
                  and stratified turbulence. Our simulations produce
                  massive (60–130 M ⊕) planetesimal belts beyond 100
                  au and up to ∼20 M ⊕ of planetesimals in the middle
                  regions (3–100 au). Our most comprehensive model
                  forms 8 M ⊕ of planetesimals inside 3 au, where they
                  can give rise to terrestrial planets. The
                  planetesimal mass formed in the inner disk depends
                  critically on the timing of the formation of an
                  inner cavity in the disk by high-energy photons. Our
                  results show that the combination of
                  photoevaporation and the streaming instability are
                  efficient at converting the solid component of
                  protoplanetary disks into planetesimals. Our model,
                  however, does not form enough early planetesimals in
                  the inner and middle regions of the disk to give
                  rise to giant planets and super-Earths with gaseous
                  envelopes. Additional processes such as particle
                  pileups and mass loss driven by MHD winds may be
                  needed to drive the formation of early planetesimal
                  generations in the planet-forming regions of
                  protoplanetary disks.},

                  structures observed in high resolution observations
                  of protoplanetary disks, and it appears that some of
                  the disks showing spiral arms in scattered light
                  also show asymmetries in millimeter-sized
                  dust. HD{\textasciitilde}135344B is one of these
                  disks. Planets are invoked as the origin of these
                  structures, but no planet has been observed so
                  far. We investigate the nature of the asymmetric
                  structure in the HD{\textasciitilde}135344B disk in
                  order to understand the origin of the spirals and of
                  the asymmetry seen in this disk. Ultimately, we aim
                  at understanding whether or not one or more planets
                  are needed to explain such structures. We present
                  new ALMA sub-0.1" resolution observations in Band 3
                  and 4. The high spatial resolution allows us to
                  characterize the mm-dust morphology of the disk. The
                  low optical depth of continuum emission probes the
                  bulk of the dust in vortex. Moreover, we combine the
                  new observations with archival data to perform a
                  multi-wavelength analysis and to obtain information
                  about the dust distribution and properties inside
                  the asymmetry. We resolve the asymmetric disk into a
                  symmetric ring + asymmetric crescent, and observe
                  that: (1) the spectral index strongly decreases at
                  the center of the vortex, consistent with the
                  presence of large grains; (2) for the first time, an
                  azimuthal shift of the peak of the vortex with
                  wavelength is observed; (3) the azimuthal width of
                  the vortex decreases at longer wavelengths, as
                  expected for dust traps. These features allow to
                  confirm the nature of the asymmetry as a
                  vortex. Finally a lower limit to the total mass of
                  the vortex is \$0.3 M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm
                  Jupiter\}\$. Considering the uncertainties involved
                  in this estimate, it is possible that the actual
                  mass of the vortex is higher and possibly within the
                  required values (\${\textbackslash}sim
                  4{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}rm
                  M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm Jupiter\}\$) to launch

  abstract =	 {The presence of planets in binary systems poses
                  interesting problems for planet formation theories,
                  both in cases where planets must have formed in very
                  compact discs around the individual stars and where
                  they are located near the edge of the stable
                  circumbinary region, where in situ formation is
                  challenging. Dust dynamics is expected to play an
                  important role in such systems, since dust trapping
                  at the inner edge of circumbinary discs could aid in
                  situ formation, but would simultaneously starve the
                  circumstellar discs of the solid material needed to
                  form planets. Here we investigate the dynamics of
                  dust in binary systems using Smooth Particle
                  Hydrodynamics. We ﬁnd that all our simulations tend
                  towards dust trapping in the circumbinary disc, but
                  the timescale on which trapping begins depends on
                  binary mass ratio (q) and eccentricity as well as
                  the angular momentum of the infalling material. For
                  q 0.1, we ﬁnd that dust can initially accrete onto
                  the circumstellar discs, but as the circumbinary
                  cavity grows in radius, dust eventually becomes
                  trapped in the circumbinary disc. For q = 0.01, we
                  ﬁnd that increasing the binary eccentricity
                  increases the time required for dust trapping to
                  begin. However, even this longer timescale is likely
                  to be shorter than the planet formation timescale in
                  the inner disc and is insuﬃcient to explain the
                  observed pre-transitional discs. This indicates that
                  increase in companion eccentricity alone is not
                  enough to allow signiﬁcant transfer of solids from
                  the outer to the inner disc.},

                  initial separations of the planets' orbits, Delta
                  a\_SJ , to investigate whether they become captured
                  in mean motion resonance (MMR) and the direction of
                  the subsequent migration of the planet (inward or

                  planet's orbital dynamics at different epochs of
                  Saturn's growth. We find that the evolution of
                  initially compact orbital configurations is

                  that an evolution as that proposed in the Grand Tack

                  three-planet systems in initially circular coplanar
                  orbits. These maps have unveiled a rich resonant
                  structure involving two or three planets, as well as
                  indicating possible migration routes from secular to
                  double resonances or pure three-planet
                  commensurabilities. These structures are then
                  compared to the present-day orbital architecture of
                  observed resonant chains. In a second part of the
                  paper, we describe N-body simulations of type-I
                  migration. Depending on the orbital decay
                  time-scale, we show that three-planet systems may be
                  trapped in different combinations of independent
                  commensurabilities: (i) double resonances, (ii)
                  intersection between a two-planet and a first-order
                  three-planet resonances, and (iii) simultaneous
                  libration in two first-order three-planet
                  resonances. These latter outcomes are found for slow
                  migrations, while double resonances are almost
                  always the final outcome in high-density
                  discs. Finally, we discuss an application to the
                  TRAPPIST-1 system. We find that, for low migration
                  rates and planetary masses of the order of the
                  estimated values, most three-planet sub-systems are
                  able to reach the observed double resonances after
                  following evolutionary routes defined by pure
                  three-planet resonances. The final orbital
                  configuration shows resonance offsets comparable
                  with present-day values without the need of tidal
                  dissipation. For the 8/5 resonance proposed to
                  dominate the dynamics of the two inner planets, we
                  find little evidence of its dynamical significance;
                  instead, we propose that this relation between mean
                  motions could be a consequence of the interaction
                  between a pure three-planet resonance and a
                  two-planet commensurability between planets c and

                  low-mass stars, whereas exoplanets' mass
                  distribution indicates that some cores have
                  transformed into gas giants through runaway gas
                  accretion at 1AU from solar-type stars. In this
                  paper, we show that transition to runaway gas
                  accretion by cores may be self-impeded by an
                  increase of the grain opacity in their envelope
                  after they have acquired sufficient mass (typically
                  10Mearth) to enter a pebble-isolation phase. The
                  accumulation of mm-m size pebbles in their migration
                  barriers enhances their local fragmentation
                  rates. The freshly produced sub-mm grains pass
                  through the barrier, elevate the effective dust
                  opacity and reduce the radiative flux in the cores
                  envelope. These effects alone are adequate to
                  suppress the transition to runaway accretion and
                  preserve super-Earths in the stellar proximity (0.1
                  AU), albeit entropy advection between the envelope
                  and the disk can further reduce the accretion
                  rate. At intermediate distance (1AU) from their host
                  stars, the escalation in the dust opacity dominates
                  over entropy advection in stalling the transition to
                  runaway accretion for marginally pebble-isolated
                  cores. Beyond a few AU, the transformation of more
                  massive cores to gas giants is reachable before
                  severe depletion of disk gas. This requirement can
                  be satisfied either in extended disks with large
                  scale height via orderly accretion of migrating
                  pebbles or through the mergers of oligarchic
                  protoplanetary embryos, and can account for the

                  orbital period are
                  \${\textbackslash}sim\$10{\textbackslash}\%,
                  supporting the view that sub-Neptunes complete their
                  formation more-or-less in situ. Once captured into
                  resonance, sub-Neptunes of typical mass
                  \${\textbackslash}sim\$\$5\$--\$15
                  M\_\{{\textbackslash}oplus\}\$ stay captured
                  (contrary to an earlier claim), as they are immune
                  to the overstability that afflicts lower mass
                  planets. Driving the limited, short-scale migration
                  is a gas disk whose surface density is fairly
                  constant inside 1 AU and depleted relative to a
                  solar-composition disk by 3--5 orders of
                  magnitude. Such gas-poor but not gas-empty
                  environments are quantitatively consistent with
                  sub-Neptune core formation by giant impacts (and
                  not, e.g., pebble accretion). While disk-planet
                  interactions at the close of the planet formation
                  era adequately explain the 3:2 and 2:1 asymmetries
                  at periods \${\textbackslash}gtrsim\$ \$5\$--\$15\$
                  days, subsequent modification by stellar tides
                  appears necessary at shorter periods, particularly
                  for the 2:1.},

  abstract =	 {Methods. We employ two distinct numerical schemes:
                  an N-body code, adapted to include migration and
                  eccentricity damping due to the gas disc via
                  analytic prescriptions, and a hydrodynamics code
                  that explicitly evolves a 2D protoplanetary disc
                  model with embedded protoplanets. The former allows
                  us to study the long term evolution, the latter to
                  model the systems with greater ﬁdelity but for
                  shorter times.  Results. After a brief period of
                  chaotic interaction between the protoplanets that
                  involves scattering, orbital exchange, collisions
                  and the formation of co-orbital planets, we ﬁnd that
                  the system settles into a quiescent state of inward
                  migration. Diﬀerential migration causes the
                  protoplanets to form a series of mean motion
                  resonances, such that a planet is often in resonance
                  with both its interior and exterior neighbours. This
                  helps prevent close encounters and leads to the
                  protoplanetary swarm, or subgroups within it,
                  migrating inward at a uniform rate. In about 2\% of
                  runs a single planet is scattered onto a distant
                  orbit with signiﬁcant eccentricity, allowing it to
                  survive in the disc for ∼106 years. Over 20\% of
                  runs produce co-orbital planets that survive for the
                  duration of the simulation, occupying mutual
                  horseshoe or tadpole orbits.
                  Conclusions. Disc-induced damping overwhelms
                  eccentricity growth through planet-planet
                  interactions, such that a protoplanetary swarm
                  migrates inward. We suggest co-orbital planets may
                  be observed in future exoplanet searches.},

                  predicts that low-mass protoplanets in a
                  protostellar disc migrate into the central star on a
                  time scale that is short compared with the disc
                  lifetime or the giant planet formation time
                  scale. Protoplanet eccentricities of can slow or
                  reverse migration, but previous 2D studies of
                  multiple protoplanets embedded in a protoplanetary
                  disc have shown that gravitational scattering cannot
                  maintain significant planet eccentricities against
                  disc-induced damping. The eventual fate of these
                  systems was migration into the central
                  star.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Aims. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}Here

                  swarms in three dimensions. The aim is to examine
                  both protoplanet survival rates and the dynamical
                  structure of the resulting planetary systems, and to
                  compare them with 2D

                  disc. We also present a suite of simulations
                  performed using an
                  {\textless}i{\textgreater}N{\textless}i/{\textgreater}-body
                  code, modified to include prescriptions for
                  planetary migration and for eccentricity and
                  inclination damping. These prescriptions were
                  obtained by fitting analytic formulae to
                  hydrodynamic simulations of planets embedded in
                  discs with initially eccentric and/or inclined
                  orbits.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}As
                  was found in two dimensions, differential migration
                  produces groups of protoplanets in stable, multiple
                  mean-motion resonances that migrate in lockstep,
                  preventing prolonged periods of gravitational
                  scattering. In almost all simulations, this leads to
                  large-scale migration of the protoplanet swarm into
                  the central star in the absence of a viable stopping
                  mechanism. The evolution involves mutual collisions,
                  occasional instances of large-scale scattering, and
                  the frequent formation of the long-lived, co-orbital
                  planet systems that arise in {\textgreater}30\% of
                  all
                  runs.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Conclusions. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}Disc-induced
                  damping overwhelms eccentricity and inclination
                  growth due to planet-planet interactions, leading to
                  large-scale migration of protoplanet
                  swarms. Co-orbital planets are a natural outcome of
                  dynamical relaxation in a strongly dissipative
                  environment, and if observed in nature would imply
                  that such a period of evolution commonly arises
                  during planetary formation.},

  abstract =	 {Although it is well known that a massive planet
                  opens a gap in a protoplanetary gaseous disk, there
                  is no analytic description of the surface density
                  profile in and near the gap. The simplest approach,
                  which is based upon the balance between the torques
                  due to the viscosity and the gravity of the planet
                  and assumes local damping, leads to gaps with
                  overestimated width, especially at low
                  viscosity. Here, we take into account the fraction
                  of the gravity torque that is evacuated by pressure
                  supported waves. With a novel approach, which
                  consists of following the fluid elements along their
                  trajectories, we show that the flux of angular
                  momentum carried by the waves corresponds to a
                  pressure torque. The equilibrium profile of the disk
                  is then set by the balance between gravity, viscous
                  and pressure torques. We check that this balance is
                  satisfied in numerical simulations, with a planet on
                  a fixed circular orbit. We then use a reference
                  numerical simulation to get an ansatz for the
                  pressure torque, that yields gap profiles for any
                  value of the disk viscosity, pressure scale height
                  and planet to primary mass ratio. Those are in good
                  agreement with profiles obtained in numerical
                  simulations over a wide range of
                  parameters. Finally, we provide a gap opening
                  criterion that simultaneously involves the planet
                  mass, the disk viscosity and the aspect ratio.},

                  formation establishes connections between
                  super-Earths’ orbital properties (semimajor axis
                  spacings, eccentricities, mutual inclinations) and
                  interior compositions (the presence or absence of
                  gaseous envelopes). Using N-body simulations and
                  analytic arguments, we show that spacings derive not
                  only from eccentricities, but also from
                  inclinations. Flatter systems attain tighter
                  spacings, a consequence of an eccentricity
                  equilibrium between gravitational scatterings, which
                  increase eccentricities, and mergers, which damp
                  them. Dynamical friction by residual disk gas plays
                  a critical role in regulating mergers and in damping
                  inclinations and eccentricities. Systems with
                  moderate gas damping and high solid surface density
                  spawn gas-enveloped super-Earths with tight
                  spacings, small eccentricities, and small
                  inclinations.  Systems in which super-Earths
                  coagulate without as much ambient gas, in disks with
                  low solid surface density, produce rocky planets
                  with wider spacings, larger eccentricities, and
                  larger mutual inclinations. A combination of both
                  populations can reproduce the observed distributions
                  of spacings, period ratios, transiting planet
                  multiplicities, and transit duration ratios
                  exhibited by Kepler super-Earths. The two

                  explain observed trends of eccentricity versus
                  planet size, and bulk density versus method of mass
                  measurement (radial velocities versus transit timing
                  variations).  Simplifications made in this

  abstract =	 {We consider the dynamical evolution of two planets
                  orbiting in the vicinity of a ﬁrst order mean motion
                  resonance while simultaneously undergoing
                  eccentricity damping and convergent
                  migration. Following Goldreich \& Schlichting
                  (2014), we include a coupling between the
                  dissipative semimajor axis evolution and the damping
                  of the eccentricities. In agreement with past
                  studies, we ﬁnd that this coupling can lead to
                  overstability of the resonance and that for a
                  certain range of parameters capture into resonance
                  is only temporary. Using a more general model, we
                  show that whether overstable motion can occur
                  depends in a characteristic way on the mass ratio
                  between the two planets as well as their relative
                  eccentricity damping timescales. Moreover, we show
                  that even when escape from resonance does occur, the
                  timescale for escape is long enough such at any
                  given time a pair of planets is more likely to be
                  found in a resonance rather than migrating between
                  them. Thus, we argue that overstability of
                  resonances cannot singlehandedly reconcile
                  convergent migration with the observed lack of
                  Kepler planet pairs found near resonances. However,
                  it is possible that overstable motion in combination
                  with other effects such as large scale orbital
                  instability could produce the observed period ratio

                  of massive stars and are dynamically active
                  environments. Here, we study the formation of black
                  holes (BHs) and binary black holes (BBHs) in young
                  star clusters, by means of 6000 N-body simulations
                  coupled with binary population synthesis. We probe
                  three different stellar metallicities (Z = 0.02,
                  0.002, and 0.0002) and two initial-density regimes
                  (density at the half-mass radius ρh ≥ 3.4 × 104 and
                  ≥1.5 × 102 M⊙ pc-3 in dense and loose star clusters,
                  respectively). Metal-poor clusters tend to form more
                  massive BHs than metal-rich ones. We find ∼6, ∼2,
                  and {\textless}1 per cent of BHs with mass mBH
                  {\textgreater} 60 M⊙ at Z = 0.0002, 0.002, and 0.02,
                  respectively. In metal-poor clusters, we form
                  intermediate-mass BHs with mass up to ∼320 M⊙. BBH
                  mergers born via dynamical exchanges (exchanged
                  BBHs) can be more massive than BBH mergers formed
                  from binary evolution: the former (latter) reach
                  total mass up to ∼140 M⊙ (∼80 M⊙). The most massive
                  BBH merger in our simulations has primary mass ∼88
                  M⊙, inside the pair-instability mass gap, and a mass
                  ratio of ∼0.5. Only BBHs born in young star clusters
                  from metal-poor progenitors can match the masses of
                  GW 170729, the most massive event in first and

                  190412, the first unequal-mass merger. We estimate a
                  local BBH merger rate density ∼110 and ∼55 Gpc-3

                  the grid-based code Athena at high spatial
                  resolution (256 grid points per scale height h). The
                  nonlinear evolution results in the wave steepening
                  into a shock, causing damping and angular momentum
                  transfer to the disk. On long timescales this leads
                  to spatial redistribution of the disk density,
                  causing migration feedback and potentially resulting
                  in gap opening. Previous numerical studies
                  concentrated on exploring these secondary phenomena
                  as probes of the nonlinear wave evolution. Here we
                  focus on exploring the evolution of the basic wave
                  properties, such as its density profile evolution,
                  shock formation, and post-shock wave behavior, and
                  provide comparison with analytical theory. The
                  generation of potential vorticity at the shock is
                  computed analytically and is subsequently verified
                  by simulations and used to pinpoint the shock
                  location. We confirm the theoretical relation
                  between the shocking length and the planet mass
                  (including the effect of the equation of state), and
                  the post-shock decay of the angular momentum flux
                  carried by the wave. The post-shock evolution of the
                  wave profile is explored, and we quantitatively
                  confirm its convergence to the theoretically
                  expected N-wave shape. The accuracy of various
                  numerical algorithms used to compute the nonlinear
                  wave evolution is also investigated: we find that
                  higher order spatial reconstruction and high

                  the use of a too large time step without properly
                  resolving the dynamical timescale around the planet
                  produces incorrect results and may lead to spurious
                  gap opening. Global simulations of planet migration
                  and gap opening violating this requirement may be
                  affected by spurious effects resulting in, e.g., the
                  incorrect planetary migration rate and gap opening

  abstract =	 {ALMA has found multiple dust gaps and rings in a
                  number of protoplanetary disks in continuum emission
                  at millimeter wavelengths. The origin of such
                  structures is in debate. Recently, we documented how
                  one super-Earth planet can open multiple (up to
                  five) dust gaps in a disk with low viscosity
                  (\${\textbackslash}alpha{\textbackslash}lesssim10{\textasciicircum}\{-4\}\$). In
                  this paper, we examine how the positions, depths,
                  and total number of gaps opened by one planet depend
                  on input parameters, and apply our results to real
                  systems. Gap locations (equivalently, spacings) are
                  the easiest metric to use when making comparisons
                  between theory and observations, as positions can be
                  robustly measured. We fit the locations of gaps
                  empirically as functions of planet mass and disk
                  aspect ratio. We find that the locations of the
                  double gaps in HL Tau and TW Hya, and of all three
                  gaps in HD 163296, are consistent with being opened
                  by a sub-Saturn mass planet. This scenario predicts
                  the locations of other gaps in HL Tau and TW Hya,
                  some of which appear consistent with current
                  observations. We also show how the Rossby wave
                  instability may develop at the edges of several gaps
                  and result in multiple dusty vortices, all caused by
                  one planet. A planet as low in mass as Mars may
                  produce multiple dust gaps in the terrestrial planet
                  forming region.},

                  transitional disk [PZ99] J160421.7-213028, with an
                  angular resolution of ∼ (35 au). Armed with these
                  data and existing H-band scattered light
                  observations, we measure the size and depth of the
                  disk’s central cavity, and the sharpness of its
                  outer edge, in three components: sub-μm-sized
                  “small” dust traced by scattered light,
                  millimeter-sized “big” dust traced by the millimeter
                  continuum, and gas traced by line emission. Both
                  dust populations feature a cavity of radius ∼70 au
                  that is depleted by factors of at least 1000
                  relative to the dust density just outside. The
                  millimeter continuum data are well explained by a
                  cavity with a sharp edge. Scattered light
                  observations can be fitted with a cavity in small
                  dust that has either a sharp edge at 60 au, or an
                  edge that transitions smoothly over an annular width
                  of 10 au near 60 au. In gas, the data are consistent
                  with a cavity that is smaller, about 15 au in
                  radius, and whose surface density at 15 au is times
                  smaller than the surface density at 70 au; the gas
                  density grades smoothly between these two radii. The
                  CO isotopologue observations rule out a sharp drop
                  in gas surface density at 30 au or a double-drop
                  model, as found by previous modeling. Future
                  observations are needed to assess the nature of
                  these gas and dust cavities (e.g., whether they are
                  opened by multiple as-yet-unseen planets or

  abstract =	 {Dust growth is often neglected when building models
                  of protoplanetary disks due to its complexity and
                  computational expense. However, it does play a major
                  role in shaping the evolution of protoplanetary dust
                  and planet formation. In this paper, we present a
                  numerical model coupling 2-D hydrodynamic evolution
                  of a protoplanetary disk, including a Jupiter-mass
                  planet, and dust coagulation. This is obtained by
                  including multiple dust fluids in a single
                  grid-based hydrodynamic simulation and solving the
                  Smoluchowski equation for dust coagulation on top of
                  solving for the hydrodynamic evolution. We find that
                  fragmentation of dust aggregates trapped in a
                  pressure bump outside of the planetary gap leads to
                  an enhancement in density of small grains. We
                  compare the results obtained from the full
                  coagulation treatment to the commonly used, fixed
                  dust size approach and to previously applied, less
                  computationally intensive methods for including dust
                  coagulation. We find that the full coagulation
                  results cannot be reproduced using the fixed-size
                  treatment, but some can be mimicked using a
                  relatively simple method for estimating the
                  characteristic dust size in every grid cell.},

                  of Kepler data and reported by Batalha et
                  al. (2013). These data show 899 transiting planet
                  candidates in 365 multiple-planet systems and
                  provide a powerful means to study the statistical
                  properties of planetary systems. Using a generic
                  mass-radius relationship, we find that only two
                  pairs of planets in these candidate systems (out of
                  761 pairs total) appear to be on Hill-unstable
                  orbits, indicating ∼96\% of the candidate planetary
                  systems are correctly interpreted as true
                  systems. We find that planet pairs show little
                  statistical preference to be near mean-motion
                  resonances. We identify an asymmetry in the
                  distribution of period ratios near first-order
                  resonances (e.g., 2:1, 3:2), with an excess of
                  planet pairs lying wide of resonance and relatively
                  few lying narrow of resonance. Finally, based upon
                  the transit duration ratios of adjacent planets in
                  each system, we find that the interior planet tends
                  to have a smaller transit impact parameter than the
                  exterior planet does. This finding suggests that the
                  mode of the mutual inclinations of planetary orbital
                  planes is in the range 1.°0-2.°2, for the packed

                  {\textasciitilde} ({\textasciitilde}35 × 20 au). The
                  dust continuum emission reveals a double-ring
                  structure with an inner ring between
                  ({\textasciitilde}20−35 au) and an outer ring
                  between ({\textasciitilde}56−83 au). The size and
                  position of the inner ring is in good agreement with
                  previous polarimetric observations in the
                  near-infrared and is consistent with dust trapping
                  by a massive planet. No dust emission is detected
                  inside the inner dust cavity
                  ({\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}i/{\textgreater}
                  ≲ 20 au) or within the dust gap
                  ({\textasciitilde}35−56 au) down to the noise
                  level. In contrast, the channel maps of the
                  {\textless}i{\textgreater}J{\textless}i/{\textgreater}
                  = 2−1 line of the three CO isotopologs reveal gas
                  inside the dust cavity and dust gap. The gaseous
                  disk is also much larger than the compact dust
                  emission; it extends to {\textasciitilde}1
                  ({\textasciitilde}180 au) in radius. This difference
                  and the sharp drop of the continuum emission at
                  large radii point to radial drift of large dust
                  grains
                  ({\textgreater}{\textless}i{\textgreater}μ{\textless}i/{\textgreater}m
                  size). Using the thermo-chemical disk code dali, we
                  modeled the continuum and the CO isotopolog emission
                  to quantitatively measure the gas and dust surface
                  densities. The resulting gas surface density is
                  reduced by a factor of {\textasciitilde}30−40 inward
                  of the dust gap. The gas and dust distribution
                  indicate that two giant planets shape the disk
                  structure through dynamical clearing (dust cavity
                  and gap) and dust trapping (double-ring dust

                  1.3 mm dust continuum observations of the
                  protoplanetary system AS 209 in the Ophiuchus star
                  forming region. The dust continuum emission is
                  characterized by a main central core and two
                  prominent rings at
                  {\textless}i{\textgreater}r{\textless}i/{\textgreater}
                  = 75 au and
                  {\textless}i{\textgreater}r{\textless}i/{\textgreater}
                  = 130 au intervaled by two gaps at
                  {\textless}i{\textgreater}r{\textless}i/{\textgreater}
                  = 62 au and
                  {\textless}i{\textgreater}r{\textless}i/{\textgreater}
                  = 103 au. The two gaps have different widths and
                  depths, with the inner one being narrower and
                  shallower. We determined the surface density of the
                  millimeter dust grains using the 3D radiative
                  transfer disk code DALI. According to our fiducial
                  model the inner gap is partially filled with
                  millimeter grains while the outer gap is largely
                  devoid of dust. The inferred surface density is
                  compared to 3D hydrodynamical simulations (FARGO-3D)
                  of planet-disk interaction. The outer dust gap is
                  consistent with the presence of a giant planet
                  ({\textless}i{\textgreater}M{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}planet{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}
                  {\textasciitilde} 0.7
                  {\textless}i{\textgreater}M{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}Saturn{\textless}sub/{\textgreater});
                  the planet is responsible for the gap opening and
                  for the pile-up of dust at the outer edge of the
                  planet orbit. The simulations also show that the
                  same planet could be the origin of the inner gap at
                  {\textless}i{\textgreater}r{\textless}i/{\textgreater}
                  = 62 au. The relative position of the two dust gaps
                  is close to the 2:1 resonance and we have
                  investigated the possibility of a second planet
                  inside the inner gap. The resulting surface density
                  (including location, width and depth of the two dust
                  gaps) are in agreement with the observations. The
                  properties of the inner gap pose a strong constraint
                  to the mass of the inner planet
                  ({\textless}i{\textgreater}M{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}planet{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}
                  {\textless} 0.1
                  {\textless}i{\textgreater}M{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}J{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}). In
                  both scenarios (single or pair of planets), the
                  hydrodynamical simulations suggest a very low disk
                  viscosity

                  the young age of the system (0.5–1 Myr), this result
                  implies that the formation of giant planets occurs
                  on a timescale of ≲1 Myr.},

  abstract =	 {The final stage of the accretion of Uranus and
                  Neptune is numerically investigated. The four Jovian
                  planets are considered with Jupiter and Saturn
                  assumed to have reached their present sizes, whereas
                  Uranus and Neptune are taken with initial masses 0.2
                  of their present ones. Allowance is made for the
                  orbital variation of the Jovian planets due to the
                  exchange of angular momentum with interacting bodies
                  ("planetesimals"). Two possible effects that may
                  have contributed to the accretion of Uranus and
                  Neptune are incorporated in our model: (1) an
                  enlarged cross section for accretion of incoming
                  planetesimals due to the presence of extended
                  gaseous envelopes and/or circumplanetary swarms of
                  bodies; and (2) intermediate protoplanets in
                  mid-range orbits between the Jovian
                  planets. Significant radial displacements are found
                  for Uranus and Neptune during their accretion and
                  scattering of planetesimals. The orbital angular
                  momentum budgets of Neptune, Uranus, and Saturn turn
                  out to be positive; i.e., they on average gain
                  orbital angular momentum in their interactions with
                  planetesimals and hence they are displaced
                  outwardly. Instead, Jupiter as the main ejector of
                  bodies loses orbital angular momentum so it moves
                  sunward. The gravitational stirring of planetesimals
                  caused by the introduction of intermediate
                  protoplanets has the effect that additional solid
                  matter is injected into the accretion zones of
                  Uranus and Neptune. For moderate enlargements of the
                  radius of the accretion cross section (2-4 times),
                  the accretion time scale of Uranus and Neptune are
                  found to be a few 10
                  {\textless}SUP{\textgreater}8{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}
                  years and the initial amount of solid material
                  required to form them of a few times their present
                  masses. Given the crucial role played by the size of
                  the accretion cross section, questions as to when
                  Uranus and Neptune acquired their gaseous envelopes,
                  when the envelopes collapsed onto the solid cores,
                  and how massive they were are essential in defining
                  the efficiency and time scale of accretion of the
                  two outer Jovian planets.},

                  reported spiral structures that are potential
                  signatures of embedded planets, and modeling efforts
                  have shown that a single planet can excite multiple
                  spiral arms, in contrast to conventional disk-planet
                  interaction theory. Using two and three-dimensional
                  hydrodynamics simulations to perform a systematic
                  parameter survey, we confirm the existence of
                  multiple spiral arms in disks with a single planet,
                  and discover a scaling relation between the
                  azimuthal separation of the primary and secondary
                  arm, \${\textbackslash}phi\_\{{\textbackslash}rm
                  sep\}\$, and the planet-to-star mass ratio \$q\$:

                  independent of the disk's temperature, and can be
                  used to infer a planet's mass to within an accuracy
                  of about 30\% given only the morphology of a face-on
                  disk. Combining hydrodynamics and Monte-Carlo
                  radiative transfer calculations, we verify that our

                  \${\textbackslash}phi\_\{{\textbackslash}rm sep\}\$
                  are accurate representations of what would be

                  scenario for overcoming dust growth barriers in dead
                  zones is the gravitational collapse of locally
                  over-dense regions, shown to robustly produce

                  the conditions under which planetesimal formation

                  of streaming and Kelvin-Helmholtz instability and
                  planetesimal formation. We find that the vertical
                  extent of the particle mid-plane layer and the
                  radial width of streaming instability filaments are
                  set by the same characteristic length scale, thus
                  governing the strength of turbulent diffusion on the
                  scales of planetesimal formation. We present and
                  successfully test a collapse criterion: \$0.1 Q
                  {\textbackslash}beta
                  {\textbackslash}epsilon{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}Z{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}
                  {\textbackslash}lesssim 1\$ and show that even for
                  Solar metallicities, planetesimals can form in dead
                  zones of sufficiently massive disks. For a given gas
                  Toomre-parameter \$Q\$, pressure gradient
                  \${\textbackslash}beta\$, metallicity \$Z\$ and
                  local particle enhancement
                  \${\textbackslash}epsilon\$, the collapse criterion
                  also provides a range of unstable scales,
                  instituting a promising path for studying initial
                  planetesimal mass distributions. Streaming
                  instability is not required for planetesimal
                  collapse, but by increasing
                  \${\textbackslash}epsilon\$, can evolve a system to
                  instability.},

                  spectacular tidal tails, spanning over 20 degrees
                  across the sky. With N-body simulations we show that
                  both distinguishing features can result from a
                  stellar-mass black hole population, comprising
                  {\textasciitilde}20 of the present-day cluster
                  mass. In this scenario, Palomar 5 formed with a
                  `normal' black hole mass fraction of a few per cent,
                  but stars were lost at a higher rate than black
                  holes, such that the black hole fraction gradually
                  increased. This inflated the cluster, enhancing
                  tidal stripping and tail formation. A gigayear from
                  now, the cluster will dissolve as a 100\% black hole
                  cluster. Initially denser clusters end up with lower

                  hole-dominated, extended star clusters are therefore
                  the likely progenitors of the recently discovered

                  (2) the torque is positive at the outer Lindblad

                  Kepler satellite in terms of current ideas about
                  orbital migration and eccentricity damping due to
                  planet-disk interactions. Our primary focus is on
                  first order mean motion resonances, which we
                  investigate analytically to lowest order in
                  eccentricity. Only a few percent of planet pairs are
                  in close proximity to a resonance. However,
                  predicted migration rates (parameterized by
                  {\textbackslash}tau
                  \_n=n/\{{\textbar}{\textbackslash}dot\{n\}{\textbar}\})
                  imply that during convergent migration most planets
                  would have been captured into first order
                  resonances. Eccentricity damping (parameterized by
                  {\textbackslash}tau
                  \_e=e/\{{\textbar}{\textbackslash}dot\{e\}{\textbar}\})
                  offers a plausible resolution. Estimates suggest τ e
                  /τ n {\textasciitilde} (h/a)2 {\textasciitilde}
                  10-2, where h/a is the ratio of disk thickness to
                  radius.  Together, eccentricity damping and orbital
                  migration give rise to an equilibrium eccentricity,
                  e eq {\textasciitilde} (τ e /τ n )1/2. Capture is
                  permanent provided e eq {\textless}{\textasciitilde}
                  μ1/3, where μ denotes the planet to star mass
                  ratio. But for e eq {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}
                  μ1/3, capture is only temporary because librations
                  around equilibrium are overstable and lead to
                  passage through resonance on timescale τ e . Most
                  Kepler planet pairs have e eq {\textgreater}
                  μ1/3. Since τ n Gt τ e is the timescale for
                  migration between neighboring resonances, only a
                  modest percentage of pairs end up trapped in
                  resonances after the disk disappears. Thus the
                  paucity of resonances among Kepler pairs should not
                  be taken as evidence for in situ planet formation or
                  the disruptive effects of disk turbulence. Planet
                  pairs close to a mean motion resonance typically
                  exhibit period ratios 1\%-2\% larger than those for
                  exact resonance. The direction of this shift
                  undoubtedly reflects the same asymmetry that
                  requires convergent migration for resonance capture.
                  Permanent resonance capture at these separations
                  from exact resonance would demand μ(τ n /τ e )1/2
                  {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde} 0.01, a value that
                  estimates of μ from transit data and (τ e /τ n )1/2
                  from theory are insufficient to match. Plausible
                  alternatives involve eccentricity damping during or
                  after disk dispersal. The overstability referred to
                  above has applications beyond those considered in
                  this investigation. It was discovered numerically by
                  Meyer \& Wisdom in their study of the tidal
                  evolution of Saturn's satellites.},

                  the ν18 secular resonance, both before and after the
                  plutino's capture into the 2:3 mean motion resonance
                  with Neptune. In the case that ν18 acted before the
                  2:3 resonance encounter, the plutino would have been
                  originally formed near 34 AU. If the plutino was
                  captured near the beginning of the migration process
                  at around 30.5 AU, then the secular resonance must
                  have acted inside the 2:3 resonance with
                  high-amplitude libration. In this case, the

                  far, we estimate the present mass of the scattered
                  disk to be in the range 0.01 to 0.1 Earth masses. We
                  review the dynamics of the scattered disk, paying
                  special attention to the mean-motion and Kozai
                  resonances. We discuss the origin of the scattered
                  objects both as coming from the Kuiper belt and as
                  remnants of the scattering process during Neptune's
                  migration. We stress the importance of the
                  mean-motion resonance coupled with the Kozai
                  resonance in raising the perihelia of scattered disk
                  objects, emphasizing that fossil and live high
                  perihelion objects could thus have been produced. We
                  analyze other mechanisms that could have implanted

                  a viscosity if the wakes damp locally, but the
                  viscosity is proportional to the damping
                  length. Damping occurs mainly by shocks even for
                  earth-mass planets. The excitation of the wake
                  follows from standard linear theory including the
                  torque cutoff. We use this as input to an

  abstract =	 {Observations of exoplanets have revealed that
                  systems with planets on closely-spaced orbits are
                  common, which motivates the question "How closely
                  can planets orbit to one another and still be
                  dynamically-stable for very long times?". To address
                  this question, we investigate the stability of
                  idealized planetary systems consisting of five
                  planets, each equal in mass to the Earth, orbiting a
                  one solar mass star. All planets orbit in the same
                  plane and in the same direction, and the planets are
                  uniformly spaced in units of mutual Hill Sphere
                  radii. Most of the systems that we integrate begin
                  with one or more planets on eccentric orbits, with
                  eccentricities \$e\$ as large as \$e= 0.05\$ being
                  considered. For a given initial orbital separation,
                  larger initial eccentricity of a single planet
                  generally leads to shorter system lifetime, with
                  little systematic dependence of which planet is
                  initially on an eccentric orbit. The approximate
                  trend of instability times increasing exponentially
                  with initial orbital separation of the planets found
                  previously for planets with initially circular
                  orbits is also present for systems with initially
                  eccentric orbits. Mean motion resonances also tend
                  to destabilize these systems, although the
                  reductions in system lifetimes are not as large as
                  for initially circular orbits. Systems with all
                  planets having initial \$e= 0.05\$ and aligned
                  periapse angles typically survive far longer than
                  systems with the same spacing in initial semi-major
                  axis and one planet with \$e= 0.05\$, but they have
                  slightly shorter lifetimes than those with planets

                  emission from the disk around the T Tauri star AS
                  209. AS 209 hosts one of the most unusual disks from

                  Project sample, the first high angular resolution
                  Atacama Large Millimeter Array survey of disks, as
                  nearly all of the emission can be explained with
                  concentric Gaussian rings. In particular, the dust
                  emission consists of a series of narrow and closely
                  spaced rings in the inner ∼60 au, two well-separated
                  bright rings in the outer disk, centered at 74 and
                  120 au, and at least two fainter emission features
                  at 90 and 130 au. We model the visibilities with a
                  parametric representation of the radial surface
                  brightness profile, consisting of a central core and
                  seven concentric Gaussian rings. Recent
                  hydrodynamical simulations of low-viscosity disks
                  show that super-Earth planets can produce the
                  multiple gaps seen in AS 209 millimeter continuum
                  emission. The 12CO line emission is centrally peaked
                  and extends out to ∼300 au, much farther than the
                  millimeter dust emission. We find axisymmetric,
                  localized deficits of CO emission around four
                  distinct radii, near 45, 75, 120, and 210 au. The
                  outermost gap is located well beyond the edge of the
                  millimeter dust emission, and therefore cannot be
                  due to dust opacity and must be caused by a genuine
                  CO surface density reduction, due either to chemical
                  effects or depletion of the overall gas content.},

                  integrable Hamiltonian model for planets’ resonant
                  motion. The new model generalizes integrable
                  Hamiltonians previously derived for ﬁrst-order
                  resonances to the case of higher-order resonances by
                  exploiting a surprising near-symmetry of the full,
                  non-integrable Hamiltonians of higher-order
                  resonances. Whereas past works have frequently
                  relied on truncated disturbing function expansions
                  to derive integrable approximations to resonant
                  motion, I show that no such expansion is necessary
                  to derive an integrable model. This enables the new
                  model to accurately capture the dynamics of both
                  ﬁrst- and higher-order resonances for eccentricities
                  up to orbit-crossing. I demonstrate that predictions
                  of the new integrable model agree well with
                  numerical integrations of resonant planet
                  pairs. Finally, I explore the secular evolution of
                  resonant planets’ eccentricities. I show that the
                  secular dynamics are governed by conservation of an
                  AMD-like quantity. I also demonstrate that secular
                  frequencies depend on planets’ resonant libration
                  amplitude and this generally gives rise to a secular
                  resonance inside the mean motion resonance at large
                  libration amplitudes. The integrable model derived
                  in this work can serve as a framework for analyzing
                  the dynamics of planetary MMRs in a wide variety of

                  naturally explain the present-day resonant orbital

                  forces due to a proto-planetary disk should not only
                  capture into mean motion resonances but also end up
                  in a specific dynamical configuration within the

                  for testing the hypothesis that a planet pair
                  resides in an ACR by directly fitting radial
                  velocity data. The ACR hypothesis strongly restricts
                  the number of free parameters describing the radial
                  velocity signal and we compare fits using this
                  highly restricted model to fits using a more
                  conventional two-planet RV model by using nested
                  sampling simulations. We apply our method to HD

                  pairs in 3:2 and 5:3 resonances, respectively. We
                  demonstrate that the observations of both systems
                  support an ACR configuration and we use the results

  abstract =	 {We present a Monte Carlo model for the structure of
                  low-mass (total mass {\textless}25 M ⊕) planetary
                  systems that form by the in situ gravitational
                  assembly of planetary embryos into final
                  planets. Our model includes distributions of mass,
                  eccentricity, inclination, and period spacing that
                  are based on the simulation of a disk of 20 M ⊕,
                  forming planets around a solar-mass star, and
                  assuming a power-law surface density distribution
                  that drops with distance a as vprop a -1.5. The
                  output of the Monte Carlo model is then subjected to
                  the selection effects that mimic the observations of
                  a transiting planet search such as that performed by
                  the Kepler satellite. The resulting comparison of
                  the output to the properties of the observed sample
                  yields an encouraging agreement in terms of the
                  relative frequencies of multiple-planet systems and
                  the distribution of the mutual inclinations when
                  moderate tidal circularization is taken into
                  account. The broad features of the period
                  distribution and radius distribution can also be
                  matched within this framework, although the model
                  underpredicts the distribution of small period
                  ratios. This likely indicates that some dissipation
                  is still required in the formation process. The most
                  striking deviation between the model and
                  observations is in the ratio of single to multiple
                  systems in that there are roughly 50\% more
                  single-planet candidates observed than are produced
                  in any model population. This suggests that some
                  systems must suffer additional attrition to reduce
                  the number of planets or increase the range of
                  inclinations.},

  abstract =	 {We investigated the formation and evolution of
                  satellite systems in a cold, extended
                  circumplanetary disc around a 10
                  \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm\{Jupiter\}\}\$ gas giant
                  which was generated by gravitational instability. We
                  use a population synthesis approach, in which we
                  seed the disc with satellite embryos and let them
                  migrate, accrete mass, collide, with subsequent
                  generations being created until the disc is
                  dissipated. In each run we choose randomly the
                  dust-to-gas ratio, dispersion- and refilling
                  time-scales, the number of embryos and their
                  starting locations in a plausible range. The disc
                  structure is the result of a 3D global disc SPH
                  simulation {\textbackslash}citep\{Szulagyi16b\}. We
                  also investigate the effect of the planet's
                  semi-major axis on the resulting satellite systems,
                  taking 50 AU as the nominal case. In the nominal
                  case we find that most satellites are close in mass
                  to the Galilean ones, with a maximum at around 3
                  \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm\{Earth\}\}\$ and form
                  typically on time-scales comparable to the
                  dispersion time-scale. We also find that about 10
                  \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm\{Earth\}\}\$ worth of
                  satellites migrate into the planet, polluting it
                  with metals. The influence of a different planet
                  semi-major axis is mainly felt through the change in
                  disc size. We find that for the discs closer to the
                  star, the satellites are lighter, formation
                  time-scales are longer, and more moons are lost into
                  the planet, as a smaller disc means easier migration
                  for the massive satellites. The probability of
                  detecting satellites like the ones in this work is
                  very low (\${\textbackslash}leq\$ 3\%) even with
                  upcoming powerful telescopes like E-ELT.},

                  protoplanetary disk that imaged the 1.25 mm dust

                  a spatial resolution of 4 and 10 au,

                  allow us to characterize the previously discovered
                  dust rings at radii of 67 and 100 au. They also
                  reveal new small scale structures, such as a dark

                  100 d orbit 30-50 per cent of Sun-like stars. Their
                  orbital configuration - measured as the period ratio
                  distribution of adjacent planets in multiplanet
                  systems - is a strong constraint for formation
                  models. Here, we use N-body simulations with
                  synthetic forces from an underlying evolving gaseous
                  disc to model the formation and long-term dynamical
                  evolution of super-Earth systems.  While the gas
                  disc is present, planetary embryos grow and migrate
                  inward to form a resonant chain anchored at the
                  inner edge of the disc. These resonant chains are
                  far more compact than the observed super-Earth
                  systems. Once the gas dissipates, resonant chains
                  may become dynamically unstable. They undergo a
                  phase of giant impacts that spreads the systems
                  out. Disc turbulence has no measurable effect on the
                  outcome. Our simulations match observations if a
                  small fraction of resonant chains remain stable,
                  while most super-Earths undergo a late dynamical
                  instability. Our statistical analysis restricts the
                  contribution of stable systems to less than 25 per
                  cent. Our results also suggest that the large
                  fraction of observed single-planet systems does not
                  necessarily imply any dichotomy in the architecture
                  of planetary systems. Finally, we use the low
                  abundance of resonances in Kepler data to argue
                  that, in reality, the survival of resonant chains
                  happens likely only in ∼5 per cent of the
                  cases. This leads to a mystery: in our simulations
                  only 50-60 per cent of resonant chains became
                  unstable, whereas at least 75 per cent (and probably
                  90-95 per cent) must be unstable to match
                  observations.},

                  mergers within the aLIGO/Virgo horizon, for which

                  fascinating byproduct of galaxy mergers in the
                  hierarchical universe. In the last stage of their
                  orbital evolution, gravitational wave radiation
                  drives the binary inspiral and produces the loudest
                  siren awaiting to be detected by gravitational wave
                  observatories.  Periodically varying emission from
                  active galactic nuclei has been proposed as a
                  powerful approach to probe such systems, although
                  none of the identified candidates are close to their
                  final coalescence such that the observed periods

                  revealed by its optical and X-ray light curves,

                  uneven mass-ratio, highly eccentric SMBH binary
                  which will merge within three years, as predicted by
                  the trajectory evolution model. If the

  abstract =	 {The formation of cold gas giants akin to Jupiter and
                  Saturn in orbit and mass is a major challenge for
                  planetesimal-driven core accretion models, due to
                  the low core growth rates far from the star. Here we
                  model the growth and migration of single
                  protoplanets that accrete planetesimals and gas. We
                  integrate the core growth rate using the fits of
                  Tanaka \& Ida (1999) to N-body simulations, which
                  provide the efficiency of accreting the
                  planetesimals that a protoplanet migrates
                  through. We take into account three constraints from
                  the Solar System and from protoplanetary discs: (1)
                  the masses of the terrestrial planets and the comet
                  reservoirs in Neptune's scattered disc and the Oort
                  cloud are consistent with a primordial planetesimal
                  population of a few Earth masses per astronomical
                  unit, (2) evidence from the asteroid belt and the
                  Kuiper belt points to a characteristic planetesimal
                  diameter of 100 km, and (3) observations of
                  protoplanetary discs indicate that the dust is
                  stirred by weak turbulence; such gas turbulence also
                  excites the inclinations of planetesimals. Our
                  nominal model built on these constraints results in
                  maximum protoplanet masses of \$0.1\$ Earth
                  masses. Ignoring constraint (1) above, we show that
                  even a planetesimal population of 1,000 Earth
                  masses, corresponding to 50 Earth masses per
                  astronomical unit, fails to produce cold gas giants
                  (although it successfully forms hot and warm gas
                  giants). We conclude that a massive planetesimal
                  reservoir is in itself insufficient to produce cold
                  gas giants. The formation of cold gas giants by
                  planetesimal accretion requires additionally that
                  planetesimals are small and that the turbulent
                  stirring is very weak, thereby violating all three
                  above constraints.},

                  from water vapour, which indicates an origin in an

                  the infalling envelope material. Once a

                  regions. There the boulders are so close to each

                  they may enter into a mean-motion resonance as a
                  consequence of the convergent planetary
                  migration. The formation of mean-motion resonances
                  is important for understanding how the planetary
                  systems are shaped in the disk
                  environments. Motivated by recent progress in the
                  comprehension of the migration of partial
                  gap-opening planets, we have investigated the
                  orbital evolution of the planet pairs in a wide
                  range of masses and disk properties with the aim to
                  find out when the resonance capture is likely to
                  happen. Using the formula for the migration
                  timescale of a gap-opening planet developed in our
                  previous work, we have derived a simple criterion
                  that allows us to predict when the migration will be
                  convergent (divergent). Further, we have verified
                  the criterion using two-dimensional hydrodynamic
                  simulations. We have found that the resonant pair of
                  planets formed at the early phase of evolution can
                  depart from the resonance at later times because the
                  migration speed of the outer planet slows down due
                  to the gap formation. Moreover, adopting our formula
                  of the migration timescale, we have also carried out
                  three-body simulations, which confirm the results of
                  hydrodynamic simulations. Finally, we have compared
                  our predictions with the observations, selecting a

  abstract =	 {We investigate the possibility of finding Earth-like
                  planets in the habitable zone of 34 nearby
                  FGK-dwarfs, each known to host one giant planet
                  exterior to their habitable zone detected by
                  RV. First we simulate the dynamics of the planetary
                  systems in their present day configurations and
                  determine the fraction of stable planetary orbits
                  within their habitable zones. Then, we postulate
                  that the eccentricity of the giant planet is a
                  result of an instability in their past during which
                  one or more other planets were ejected from the
                  system. We simulate these scenarios and investigate
                  whether planets orbiting in the habitable zone
                  survive the instability. Explicitly we determine the
                  fraction of test particles, originally found in the
                  habitable zone, which remain in the habitable zone
                  today. We label this fraction the resilient
                  habitability of a system. We find that for most
                  systems the probability of planets existing [or
                  surviving] on stable orbits in the habitable zone
                  becomes significantly smaller when we include a
                  phase of instability in their history. We present a
                  list of candidate systems with high resilient
                  habitability for future observations. These are: HD
                  95872, HD 154345, HD 102843, HD 25015, GJ 328, HD
                  6718 and HD 150706. The known planets in the last
                  two systems have large observational uncertainties
                  on their eccentricities, which propagate into large
                  uncertainties on their resilient
                  habitability. Further observational constraints of

                  track simultaneously the evolution of gas and solids
                  in protoplanetary disks from an early stage, when
                  all solids are in the dust form, to the stage when
                  most solids are in the form of a planetesimal
                  swarm. The model is computationally efficient and
                  allows for a global, comprehensive approach to the
                  evolution of solid particles due to gas-solid
                  coupling, coagulation, sedimentation, and
                  evaporation/condensation. The co-evolution of gas
                  and solids is calculated for
                  10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}7{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}
                  yr for several evolution regimes and starting from a
                  comprehensive domain of initial conditions. The
                  output of a single evolutionary run is a spatial
                  distribution of mass locked in a planetesimal
                  swarm. Because swarm's mass distribution is related
                  to the architecture of a nascent planetary system,
                  diversity of swarms is taken as a proxy for a
                  diversity of planetary systems. We have found that
                  disks with low values of specific angular momentum
                  are bled out of solids and do not form planetary
                  systems. Disks with high and intermediate values of
                  specific angular momentum form diverse planetary
                  systems. Solar-like planetary systems form from
                  disks with initial masses

                  planetary systems with one to seven transiting
                  planets packed within 0.7 au from their host
                  stars. There is an apparent excess of single-transit
                  planet systems that cannot be explained by transit
                  geometries alone, when a single planetary mutual
                  inclination dispersion is assumed. This suggests
                  that the observed compact planetary systems have at
                  least two different architectures. We present a
                  scenario where the “Kepler dichotomy” may be
                  explained by the action of an external giant planet
                  or stellar companion misaligned with the inner
                  multi-planet system. The external companion excites
                  mutual inclinations of the inner planets, causing
                  such systems to appear as “Kepler singles” in
                  transit surveys. We derive approximate analytic
                  expressions (in various limiting regimes),

                  secular resonances may lead to large mutual

                  their surrounding protoplanetary disks are often
                  postulated to produce the observed complex dust
                  substructures, including rings, gaps, and
                  asymmetries. In this Letter, we explore the
                  consequences of dust coagulation on the dust
                  dynamics and ring morphology. Coagulation of dust
                  grains leads to dust size growth that, under typical
                  disk conditions, produces faster radial drifts,
                  potentially threatening the dust ring
                  formation. Utilizing 2D hydrodynamical simulations
                  of protoplanetary disks that include a full
                  treatment of dust coagulation, we find that if the

                  formation of an inner ring is impeded due to dust
                  coagulation and subsequent radial
                  drift. Furthermore, we find that a "buildup" of

                  in 2:1 orbital resonance about the star GJ 876 has
                  been supplemented by a dynamical fit to the data by
                  Laughlin \& Chambers, which places the planets in
                  coplanar orbits deep in three resonances at the 2:1
                  mean-motion commensurability. The selection of this
                  almost singular state by the dynamical fit means
                  that the resonances are almost certainly real, and
                  with the small amplitudes of libration of the
                  resonance variables, indefinitely stable. Several
                  unusual properties of the 2:1 resonances are
                  revealed by the GJ 876 system. The libration of both
                  lowest order mean-motion resonance variables and the
                  secular resonance variable, θ1=λ1- 2λ2+ϖ1, θ2=λ1-
                  2λ2+ϖ2, and θ3=ϖ1-ϖ2, about 0° (where λ1,2 are the
                  mean longitudes of the inner and outer planet and
                  ϖ1,2 are the longitudes of periapse) differs from
                  the familiar geometry of the Io-Europa pair, where
                  θ2 and θ3 librate about 180°. By considering the
                  condition that ϖ1=ϖ2 for stable simultaneous
                  librations of θ1 and θ2, we show that the GJ 876
                  geometry results from the large orbital
                  eccentricities ei, whereas the very small
                  eccentricities in the Io-Europa system lead to the
                  latter's geometry. Surprisingly, the GJ 876
                  configuration, with θ1, θ2, and θ3 all librating,
                  remains stable for e1 up to 0.86 and for amplitude
                  of libration of θ1 approaching 45° with the current
                  eccentricities-further supporting the indefinite
                  stability of the existing system. Any process that
                  drives originally widely separated orbits toward
                  each other could result in capture into the observed
                  resonances at the 2:1 commensurability. We find that
                  forced inward migration of the outer planet of the
                  GJ 876 system results in certain capture into the
                  observed resonances if initially
                  e1{\textless}{\textasciitilde}0.06 and
                  e2{\textless}{\textasciitilde}0.03 and the migration
                  rate
                  {\textbar}a2/a2{\textbar}{\textless}{\textasciitilde}3×10-
                  2(a2/AU)-3/2yr-1. Larger eccentricities lead to
                  likely capture into higher order resonances before
                  the 2:1 commensurability is reached. The planets are
                  sufficiently massive to open gaps in the nebular
                  disk surrounding the young GJ 876 and to clear the
                  disk material between them, and the resulting
                  planet-nebular interaction typically forces the
                  outer planet to migrate inward on the disk viscous
                  timescale, whose inverse is about 3 orders of
                  magnitude less than the above upper bound on
                  {\textbar}a2/a2{\textbar} for certain capture. If
                  there is no eccentricity damping, eccentricity
                  growth is rapid with continued migration within the
                  resonance, with ei exceeding the observed values
                  after a further reduction in the semimajor axes ai
                  of only 7\%. With eccentricity damping
                  ei/ei=-K{\textbar}ai/ai{\textbar}, the
                  eccentricities reach equilibrium values that remain
                  constant for arbitrarily long migration within the
                  resonances. The equilibrium eccentricities are close
                  to the observed eccentricities for
                  K{\textasciitilde}100 if there is migration and
                  damping of the outer planet only, but for
                  K{\textasciitilde}10 if there is also migration and
                  damping of the inner planet. This result is
                  independent of the magnitude or functional form of
                  the migration rate ai as long as
                  ei/ei=-K{\textbar}ai/ai{\textbar}. Although existing
                  analytic estimates of the effects of planet-nebula
                  interaction are consistent with this form of
                  eccentricity damping for certain disk parameter
                  values, it is as yet unclear that such interaction
                  can produce the large value of K required to obtain
                  the observed eccentricities. The alternative
                  eccentricity damping by tidal dissipation within the
                  star or the planets is completely negligible, so the
                  observed dynamical properties of the GJ 876 system
                  may require an unlikely fine-tuning of the time of
                  resonance capture to be near the end of the nebula
                  lifetime.},

  abstract =	 {An unknown absorber near the cloud top level of
                  Venus generates a broad absorption feature from the
                  ultraviolet (UV) to visible, peaking around 360 nm,
                  and therefore plays a critical role in the solar
                  energy absorption. We present a quantitative study
                  on the variability of the cloud albedo at 365 nm and
                  its impact on Venus' solar heating rates based on an
                  analysis of Venus Express and Akatsuki's UV images,
                  and Hubble Space Telescope and MESSENGER's UV
                  spectral data; in this analysis the calibration
                  correction factor of the UV images of Venus Express
                  (VMC) is updated relative to the Hubble and
                  MESSENGER albedo measurements. Our results indicate
                  that the 365-nm albedo varied by a factor of 2 from
                  2006 to 2017 over the entire planet, producing a
                  25-40\% change in the low latitude solar heating
                  rate according to our radiative transfer
                  calculations. Thus, the cloud top level atmosphere
                  should have experienced considerable solar heating
                  variations over this period. Our global circulation
                  model calculations show that this variable solar
                  heating rate may explain the observed variations of
                  zonal wind from 2006 to 2017. Overlaps in the
                  timescale of the long-term UV albedo and the solar
                  activity variations make it plausible that solar
                  extreme UV intensity and cosmic-ray variations
                  influenced the observed albedo trends. The albedo
                  variations might also be linked with temporal
                  variations of the upper cloud SO2 gas abundance,
                  which affects the H2SO4-H2O aerosol formation.},

                  systems is one of the cornerstones of understanding
                  planet formation and evolution. Resonant systems are
                  especially important as the fragility of their
                  orbital configuration ensures that no significant
                  scattering or collisional event has taken place
                  since the earliest formation phase when the parent
                  protoplanetary disc was still present. In this
                  context, TOI-178 has been the subject of particular
                  attention since the first TESS observations hinted
                  at a 2:3:3 resonant chain. Here we report the
                  results of observations from CHEOPS, ESPRESSO, NGTS,
                  and SPECULOOS with the aim of deciphering the
                  peculiar orbital architecture of the system. We show
                  that TOI-178 harbours at least six planets in the
                  super-Earth to mini-Neptune regimes, with radii
                  ranging from 1.152(-0.070/+0.073) to
                  2.87(-0.13/+0.14) Earth radii and periods of 1.91,
                  3.24, 6.56, 9.96, 15.23, and 20.71 days. All planets
                  but the innermost one form a 2:4:6:9:12 chain of
                  Laplace resonances, and the planetary densities show
                  important variations from planet to planet, jumping
                  from 1.02(+0.28/-0.23) to 0.177(+0.055/-0.061) times
                  the Earth's density between planets c and d. Using
                  Bayesian interior structure retrieval models, we
                  show that the amount of gas in the planets does not
                  vary in a monotonous way, contrary to what one would
                  expect from simple formation and evolution models

                  peculiar orbital configuration and the diversity in
                  average density among the planets in the system will
                  enable the study of interior planetary structures
                  and atmospheric evolution, providing important clues

                  embedded in a dusty protoplanetary disk on the dust
                  dynamics and its observational implications. By
                  carrying out high-resolution 2D gas and dust
                  two-fluid hydrodynamical simulations, we find that
                  the planet's orbit can be circularized at large
                  radii. After the planet's orbit is circularized,
                  partial gap opening and dust ring formation happen
                  close to the planet's circularization radius, which
                  can explain the observed gaps/rings at the outer
                  region of disks. When the disk mass and viscosity
                  become low, we find that an eccentric planet can
                  even open gaps and produce dust rings close to the
                  pericenter and apocenter radii before its
                  circularization. This offers alternative scenarios
                  for explaining the observed dust rings and gaps in
                  protoplanetary disks. A lower disk viscosity is
                  favored to produce brighter rings in
                  observations. An eccentric planet can also
                  potentially slow down the dust radial drift in the
                  outer region of the disk when the disk viscosity is
                  low (\${\textbackslash}alpha

                  and centimeter sizes is the early step toward the
                  formation of planets inside protoplanetary disks
                  (PPDs). However, such processes and their potential
                  impact on the later stages of solid growth are still
                  poorly understood. In this work, we test the
                  hypothesis that most disks contain at least one
                  ringed structure with a relatively small radius. We
                  have carried out a large family of 1D two-fluid
                  (gas+dust) hydrodynamical simulations by evolving
                  the gas and dust motion self-consistently while
                  allowing dust size to evolve via coagulation and
                  fragmentation. We investigate the joint effects of
                  ringed structures and dust size growth on the
                  overall submillimeter and millimeter flux and
                  spectral index of PPDs. Ringed structures slow down
                  the dust radial drift and speed up the dust
                  growth. In particular, we find that those unresolved
                  disks with a high fragmentation velocity (∼10 m
                  s{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}−1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater})
                  and a high dust surface density (∼10 g
                  cm{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}−2{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}
                  in the ring) can have millimeter spectral indices as
                  low as ∼2.0, consistent with millimeter observations
                  of faint disks in nearby star-forming
                  regions. Furthermore, disks with more than one
                  ringed structure can potentially reproduce brighter
                  disks with spectral indices lower than ∼2.5. Future
                  multiwavelength high-resolution observations of
                  these low-spectral-index sources can be used to test
                  the existence of the ringed structures in the
                  unresolved disks and differentiate the effects of
                  dust size growth from optical depth.},

  abstract =	 {We perform a series of high-resolution 2D
                  hydrodynamical simulations of equal-mass binary
                  black holes (BBHs) embedded in active galactic
                  nucleus (AGN) accretion disks to study whether these
                  binaries can be driven to merger by the surrounding
                  gas. We find that the gravitational softening
                  adopted for the BBH has a profound impact on this
                  result. When the softening is less than ten percent
                  of the binary separation, we show that, in agreement
                  with recent simulations of isolated equal-mass
                  binaries, prograde BBHs expand in time rather than
                  contract. Eventually, however, the binary separation
                  becomes large enough that the tidal force of the
                  central AGN disrupts them. Only when the softening
                  is relatively large do we find that prograde BBHs
                  harden. We determine through detailed analysis of
                  the binary torque, that this dichotomy is due to a
                  loss of spiral structure in the circum-single disks
                  orbiting each BH when the softening is a significant
                  fraction of the binary separation. Properly
                  resolving these spirals -- both with high resolution
                  and small softening -- results in a significant
                  source of binary angular momentum. Only for
                  retrograde BBHs do we find consistent hardening,
                  regardless of softening, as these BBHs lack the
                  important spiral structure in their circum-single
                  disks. This suggests that the gas-driven inspiral of
                  retrograde binaries can produce a population of
                  compact BBHs in the gravitational-wave-emitting
                  regime in AGN disks, which may contribute a large
                  fraction to the observed BBH mergers.},

                  the instability becomes nonlinear? Specifically,
                  does it lead to vortex formation? (2) What is the
                  detailed behavior of a vortex? (3) Can the
                  instability sustain itself and can the vortex last a
                  long time? Among various initial equilibria that we
                  have examined, we generally find that there are
                  three stages of the disk evolution: (1) The
                  exponential growth of the initial small amplitude
                  perturbations. This is in excellent agreement with
                  the linear theory; (2) The production of large scale
                  vortices and their interactions with the background
                  flow, including shocks. Significant accretion is
                  observed due to these vortices. (3) The coupling of
                  Rossby waves/vortices with global spiral waves,
                  which facilitates further accretion throughout the
                  whole disk. Even after more than 20 revolutions at
                  the radius of vortices, we find that the disk
                  maintains a state that is populated with vortices,
                  shocks, spiral waves/shocks, all of which transport
                  angular momentum outwards. We elucidate the physics
                  at each stage and show that there is an efficient
                  outward angular momentum transport in stages (2) and
                  (3) over most parts of the disk, with an
                  \${\textbackslash}alpha\$ in the range from
                  \$10{\textasciicircum}\{-4\}\$ to
                  \$10{\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$. We show why such
                  vortices prove to be almost ideal ``units'' in
                  transporting angular momentum outwards, namely by
                  positively correlating the radial and azimuthal
                  velocity components. We find some special cases in
                  which entropy can remain the same while angular
                  momentum is transported. We conclude that Rossby
                  wave/vortex instability is an efficient, purely
                  hydrodynamic mechanism for angular momentum
                  transport in thin disks.},

  abstract =	 {On September 14, 2015 at 09:50:45 UTC the two
                  detectors of the Laser Interferometer
                  Gravitational-Wave Observatory simultaneously
                  observed a transient gravitational-wave signal. The
                  signal sweeps upwards in frequency from 35 to 250 Hz
                  with a peak gravitational-wave strain of
                  1.0×10−21. It matches the waveform predicted by
                  general relativity for the inspiral and merger of a
                  pair of black holes and the ringdown of the
                  resulting single black hole. The signal was observed
                  with a matched-filter signal-to-noise ratio of 24
                  and a false alarm rate estimated to be less than 1
                  event per 203 000 years, equivalent to a
                  significance greater than 5.1σ. The source lies at a
                  luminosity distance of 410+160−180 Mpc corresponding
                  to a redshift z=0.09+0.03−0.04. In the source frame,
                  the initial black hole masses are 36+5−4M⊙ and
                  29+4−4M⊙, and the final black hole mass is 62+4−4M⊙,
                  with 3.0+0.5−0.5M⊙c2 radiated in gravitational
                  waves. All uncertainties define 90\% credible
                  intervals. These observations demonstrate the
                  existence of binary stellar-mass black hole
                  systems. This is the first direct detection of
                  gravitational waves and the first observation of a
                  binary black hole merger.},

                  Stokes numbers approach unity. While fast, pebble
                  accretion is also lossy. Gas drag brings pebbles to
                  protocores but also sweeps them past; those
                  particles with the largest accretion cross-sections
                  also have the fastest radial drift speeds and are
                  the most easily drained out of discs. We present a
                  global model of planet formation by pebble accretion
                  that keeps track of the disc's mass budget. Cores,
                  each initialized with a lunar mass, grow from discs
                  whose finite stores of mm-cm sized pebbles drift
                  inward across all radii in viscously accreting
                  gas. For every 1 \$M\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$ netted
                  by a core, at least 10 \$M\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$
                  and possibly much more are lost to radial
                  drift. Core growth rates are typically exponentially
                  sensitive to particle Stokes number, turbulent Mach
                  number, and solid surface density. This exponential
                  sensitivity, when combined with disc migration,
                  tends to generate binary outcomes from 0.1-30 AU:
                  either sub-Earth cores remain sub-Earth, or explode
                  into Jupiters, with the latter migrating inward to
                  varying degrees. When Jupiter-breeding cores
                  assemble from mm-cm sized pebbles, they do so in
                  discs where such particles drain out in
                  \${\textbackslash}sim\$10\${\textasciicircum}5\$ yr
                  or less; such fast-draining discs do not fit mm-wave
                  observations.},

                  star 51 Pegasi represent a breakthrough in the
                  search for extrasolar planetary systems.  Analysis
                  of systematic variations in the velocity of the star
                  indicate that the mass of the companion is
                  approximately that of Jupiter, and that it is
                  travelling in a nearly circular orbit at a distance
                  from the star of 0.05 AU (about seven stellar
                  radii). Here we show that, if the companion is
                  indeed a gas-giant planet, it is extremely unlikely
                  to have formed at its present location. We suggest
                  instead that the planet probably formed by gradual
                  accretion of solids and capture of gas at a much
                  larger distance from the star ({\textasciitilde}5
                  AU), and that it subsequently migrated inwards
                  through interactions with the remnants of the
                  circumstellar disk. The planet's migration may have
                  stopped in its present orbit as a result of tidal
                  interactions with the star, or through truncation of

                  depleted dust gaps at 60, 100 and 160 au in the 1.3
                  mm continuum as well as CO depletion in the middle
                  and outer dust gaps. However, no CO depletion was
                  found in the inner dust gap. To examine the
                  planet--disk interaction model, we present results
                  of two-dimensional two fluid (gas + dust)
                  hydrodynamic simulations coupled with
                  three-dimensional radiative transfer simulations. In
                  order to fit the high gas-to-dust ratio of the first
                  gap, we find the Shakura--Sunyaev viscosity
                  parameter \${\textbackslash}alpha\$ must be very
                  small (\${\textbackslash}lesssim
                  10{\textasciicircum}\{-4\}\$) in the inner disk. On
                  the other hand, a relatively large
                  \${\textbackslash}alpha\$ (\${\textbackslash}sim
                  7.5{\textbackslash}times
                  10{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$) is required to
                  reproduce the dust surface density in the outer
                  disk. We interpret the variation of
                  \${\textbackslash}alpha\$ as an indicator of the
                  transition from an inner dead zone to the outer
                  magnetorotational instability (MRI) active
                  zone. Within \${\textbackslash}sim 100\$ au, the HD
                  163296 disk's ionization level is low, and non-ideal
                  magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) effects could suppress the
                  MRI, so the disk can be largely laminar. The disk's
                  ionization level gradually increases toward larger
                  radii, and the outermost disk (\$r {\textgreater}
                  300\$ au) becomes turbulent due to MRI. Under this
                  condition, we find that the observed dust continuum
                  and CO gas line emissions can be reasonably fit by
                  three half-Jovian-mass planets (0.46, 0.46 and 0.58
                  \$M\_{\textbackslash}textrm\{J\}\$) at 59, 105 and

                  uniform disk is studied in this paper, through
                  analytical and numerical approaches. We develop the
                  secular approximation of this problem and obtain the
                  averaged Hamiltonian for this system first. We find
                  that, when the ratio of the semimajor axes of the
                  inner orbit and the disk radius takes very small
                  values (\${\textbackslash}ll1\$), and if the
                  inclination between the inner orbit and the disk is
                  greater than the critical value of
                  \$30{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ\$, the
                  inner orbit will undergo the (classical) Lidov-Kozai
                  resonance in which variations of eccentricity and
                  inclination are usually very large and the system
                  has two equilibrium points at
                  \${\textbackslash}omega={\textbackslash}pi/2,3{\textbackslash}pi/2\$
                  (\${\textbackslash}omega\$ is the argument of
                  perihelion). The critical value will slightly drop
                  to about
                  \$27{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ\$ as the
                  ratio increases to 0.4. However, the secular
                  resonances will not occur for the outer orbit and
                  the variations of the eccentricity and inclination
                  are small. When the ratio of the orbit and the disk
                  radius is nearly \$1\$, there are many more
                  complicated Lidov-Kozai resonance types which lead
                  to the orbital behaviors that are different from the
                  classical Lidov-Kozai case. In these resonances, the
                  system has more equilibrium points which could
                  appear at
                  \${\textbackslash}omega=0,{\textbackslash}pi/2,{\textbackslash}pi,3{\textbackslash}pi/2\$,
                  and even other values of
                  \${\textbackslash}omega\$. The variations of
                  eccentricity and inclination become relatively
                  moderate, moreover, in some cases the orbit can be
                  maintained at a highly inclined state. In addition,
                  a analysis shows that a Kuzmin disk can also lead to
                  the (classical) Lidov-Kozai resonance and the
                  critical inclination is also
                  \$30{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ\$.},

                  and migration of a large number of individual
                  protoplanetary embryos are simulated in a population
                  synthesis manner. We test two hypotheses for the
                  birth locations of embryos: at the water ice line or
                  log-uniformly distributed over entire protoplanetary
                  disks. Two types of disks with different turbulent
                  viscous parameters alpha of 1e-3 and 1e-4 are
                  investigated, to shed light on the role of outward
                  migration of protoplanets. The forming planets are
                  compared with the observed exoplanets in terms of
                  masses, semimajor axes, metallicities, and water
                  contents. We find that gas giant planets are likely
                  to form when the characteristic disk sizes are
                  larger, the disk accretion rates are higher, the
                  disks are more metal-rich and/or their stellar hosts
                  are more massive. Our model shows that 1) the
                  characteristic mass of super-Earth is set by the
                  pebble isolation mass. Super-Earth masses increase
                  linearly with the mass of its stellar host,
                  corresponding to one Earth mass around a late
                  M-dwarf star and 20 Earth masses around a solar-mass
                  star. 2) The low-mass planets up to 20 Earth masses
                  can form around stars with a wide range of
                  metallicities, while massive gas giant planets are
                  preferred to grow around metal-rich stars. 3)
                  Super-Earth planets that are mainly composed of
                  silicates, with relatively low water fractions can
                  form from protoplanetary embryos at the water ice
                  line in weakly turbulent disks where outward
                  migration is suppressed. However, if the embryos are
                  formed over a wide range of radial distances, the
                  super-Earths would end up having a distinctive,
                  bimodal composition in water mass. Our model
                  succeeds in quantitatively reproducing several
                  important observed properties of exoplanets and
                  correlations with their stellar hosts.},

                  4.6, 7.1, and 9.5 days, respectively. We provide
                  measurements of transit times and a transit timing
                  variation (TTV) dynamical analysis. We find that
                  TTVs cannot reliably detect eccentricities for this
                  system, though mass estimates are not
                  affected. Restricting the eccentricity to a
                  reasonable range, we infer masses for the outer four
                  planets (d, e, b, and c) to be \{6.75\}-0.51+0.69,
                  \{4.13\}-0.95+0.81, \{6.93\}-0.70+1.05, and
                  \{6.74\}-0.86+1.23 Earth masses, respectively. The
                  similar masses but different radii are consistent
                  with terrestrial compositions for d and e and ∼2\%
                  H/He envelopes for b and c. We confirm that the
                  outer four planets are in a rare dynamical
                  configuration with four interconnected three-body
                  resonances that are librating with few degree
                  amplitudes. We present a formation model that can
                  reproduce the observed configuration by starting
                  with a multi-resonant chain and introducing
                  dissipation. Overall, the information-rich Kepler-80
                  planets provide an important perspective into
                  exoplanetary systems.},

                  diversity in their compositional and orbital
                  properties. Their bulk densities span a large range,
                  from those dense enough to be purely rocky to those
                  needing a substantial contribution from volatiles to
                  their volumes. Their orbital configurations range
                  from compact, circular multitransiting systems like
                  Kepler-11 to systems like our solar system’s
                  terrestrial planets with wider spacings and modest
                  but significant eccentricities and mutual
                  inclinations. Here we investigate whether a
                  continuum of formation conditions resulting from
                  variation in the amount of solids available in the
                  inner disk can account for the diversity of orbital
                  and compositional properties observed for
                  super-Earths, including the apparent dichotomy
                  between single and multitransiting systems. We
                  simulate in situ formation of super-Earths via giant
                  impacts and compare to the observed Kepler
                  sample. We find that intrinsic variations among
                  disks in the amount of solids available for in situ
                  formation can account for the orbital and
                  compositional diversity observed among Kepler’s
                  transiting planets. Our simulations can account for
                  the planets’ distributions of orbital period ratios,
                  transit duration ratios, and transit multiplicity;
                  higher eccentricities for planets in single
                  transiting systems than for those in multitransiting
                  systems; smaller eccentricities for larger planets;
                  scatter in the mass–radius relation, including lower
                  densities for planets with masses measured with
                  transit timing variations instead of with radial
                  velocity; and similarities in planets’ sizes and
                  spacings within each system. Our findings support
                  the theory that variation among super-Earth and
                  mini-Neptune properties is primarily locked in by
                  different in situ formation conditions, rather than
                  arising stochastically through subsequent
                  evolution.},

                  thousands of exoplanets known today typically formed
                  where we observe them or formed further out in the
                  disk and migrated in. Early discoveries of giant
                  exoplanets orbiting near their host stars and
                  exoplanets in or near mean motion resonances were
                  interpreted as evidence for migration and its
                  crucial role in the beginnings of planetary
                  systems. Long-scale migration has been invoked to
                  explain systems of planets in mean motion resonant
                  chains consisting of three or more planets linked by
                  integer period ratios. However, recent studies have
                  reproduced specific resonant chains in systems via
                  short-scale migration, and eccentricity damping has
                  been shown to capture planets into resonant
                  chains. We investigate whether the observed resonant
                  chains in Kepler-80, Kepler-223, Kepler-60, and
                  TRAPPIST-1 can be established through long-scale
                  migration, short-scale migration, and/or only
                  eccentricity damping by running suites of N-body
                  simulations. We find that, for each system, all
                  three mechanisms are able to reproduce the observed
                  resonant chains. Long-scale migration is not the
                  only plausible explanation for resonant chains in
                  these systems, and resonant chains are potentially
                  compatible with in situ formation.},

                  analyze them together with archival 0.89 and 1.3 mm
                  data. Our observations resolve three out of the four
                  rings in the disk previously seen in high-resolution
                  ALMA data. A simple parametric model is used to
                  estimate the radial proﬁle of the dust optical
                  depth, temperature, density, and particle size
                  distribution. We ﬁnd that the multiple ring features
                  of the disk are produced by annular accumulations of
                  large particles, probably associated with gas
                  pressure bumps. Our model indicates that the maximum
                  dust grain size in the rings is ∼ 1 cm, with
                  slightly ﬂatter power-law size distributions than
                  the ISM-like size distribution (p ∼ 3.5) found in
                  the gaps. In particular, the inner ring (∼ 26 au) is
                  associated with a strong and narrow buildup of dust
                  particles that could harbor the necessary conditions
                  to trigger the streaming instability. According to
                  our analysis, the snowlines of the most important
                  volatiles do not coincide with the observed
                  substructures. We explore diﬀerent ring formation
                  mechanisms and ﬁnd that planet-disk interactions are
                  the most likely scenario to explain the main
                  features of HD 169142. Overall, our multi-wavelength
                  analysis provides some of the ﬁrst unambiguous
                  evidence of the presence of radial dust traps in the
                  rings of HD 169142. A similar analysis in a larger
                  sample of disks could provide key insights on the

                  analyses found in textbooks report that libration
                  widths of ﬁrst order mean motion resonances diverge
                  for nearly circular orbits. Here we examine the
                  nature of this divergence with a non-perturbative
                  analysis of a few ﬁrst order resonances interior to
                  a Jupiter-mass planet. We show that a ﬁrst order
                  resonance has two branches, the pericentric and the
                  apocentric resonance zone. As the eccentricity
                  approaches zero, the centers of these zones diverge
                  away from the nominal resonance location but their
                  widths shrink. We also report a novel ﬁnding of

                  resonant migration across large radial distances in

                  resonance-locked orbit of Pluto has long been a
                  puzzle. A possible explanation has been proposed
                  recently [Malhotra, 1993, Nature, 365, 819] which
                  suggests that these extraordinary orbital properties
                  may be a natural consequence of the formation and
                  early dynamical evolution of the outer solar
                  system. A resonance capture mechanism is possible
                  during the clearing of the residual planetesimal
                  debris and the formation of the Oort Cloud of comets
                  by planetesimal mass loss from the vicinity of the
                  giant planets. If this mechanism were in operation
                  during the early history of the planetary system,
                  the entire region between the orbit of Neptune and
                  approximately 50 AU would have been swept by
                  first-order mean motion resonances. Thus, resonance
                  capture could occur not only for Pluto, but quite
                  generally for other trans-Neptunian small
                  bodies. Some consequences of this evolution for the
                  present-day dynamical structure of the
                  trans-Neptunian region are (i) most of the objects
                  in the region beyond Neptune and up to ̃50 AU exist
                  in very narrow zones located at orbital resonances
                  with Neptune (particularly the 3:2 and the 2:1
                  resonances); and (ii) these resonant objects would
                  have significantly large eccentricities. The
                  distribution of objects in the Kuiper Belt as

  abstract =	 {We perform two-dimensional hydrodynamical
                  simulations to quantitatively explore the torque
                  balance criterion for gap-opening (as formulated by
                  Crida et al. 2006) in a variety of disks when
                  considering a migrating planet. We find that even
                  when the criterion is satisfied, there are instances
                  when planets still do not open gaps. We stress that
                  gap-opening is not only dependent on whether a
                  planet has the ability to open a gap, but whether it
                  can do so quickly enough. This can be expressed as
                  an additional condition on the gap-opening timescale
                  versus the crossing time, i.e. the time it takes the
                  planet to cross the region which it is carving
                  out. While this point has been briefly made in the
                  previous literature, our results quantify it for a
                  range of protoplanetary disk properties and
                  planetary masses, demonstrating how crucial it is
                  for gap-opening. This additional condition has
                  important implications for the survival of planets
                  formed by core accretion in low mass disks as well
                  as giant planets or brown dwarfs formed by
                  gravitational instability in massive disks. It is
                  particularly important for planets with intermediate
                  masses susceptible to Type III-like migration. For
                  some observed transition disks or disks with gaps,
                  we expect that estimates on the potential planet
                  masses based on the torque balance gap-opening
                  criterion alone may not be sufficient. With
                  consideration of this additional timescale criterion
                  theoretical studies may find a reduced planet
                  survivability or that planets may migrate further
                  inwards before opening a gap.},

                  periods of P=30.1 and 61.0 days, semimajor axes of

                  0.10, respectively. The orbital periods are nearly
                  in the ratio of 2:1, unprecedented among major
                  planets but common among moons and
                  asteroids. Moreover, the axes of the elliptical
                  orbits appear to be nearly aligned. The inner
                  companion was not recognized previously owing to the
                  2:1 ratio of periods, which allowed its signature to

                  evolution of planetary mass and stellar mass and

                  interactions in inviscid three dimensional discs. We
                  show that a wind-driven laminar accretion flow
                  through the surface layers of the disc does not
                  significantly modify the migration torque
                  experienced by embedded planets. More importantly,
                  we find that 3D effects lead to a dramatic change in
                  the behaviour of the dynamical corotation torque
                  compared to earlier 2D theory and
                  simulations. Whereas it was previously shown that
                  the dynamical corotation torque could act to slow
                  and essentially stall the inward migration of a low
                  mass planet, our results in 3D show that the
                  dynamical corotation torque has the complete
                  opposite effect and speeds up inward migration. Our
                  numerical experiments implicate buoyancy resonances
                  as the cause. These have two effects: (i) they exert
                  a direct torque on the planet, whose magnitude
                  relative to the Lindblad torque is measured in our
                  simulations to be small; (ii) they torque the gas
                  librating on horseshoe orbits in the corotation
                  region and drive evolution of its vortensity,
                  leading to the negative dynamical corotation
                  torque. This indicates that at low turbulent
                  viscosity, the detailed vertical thermal structure
                  of the protoplanetary disc plays an important role
                  in determining the migration behaviour of embedded
                  planets. If this result holds up under more a
                  refined treatment of disc thermal evolution, then it
                  has important implications for understanding the
                  formation and early evolution of planetary systems.},

                  e-Enceladus resonance angle of 1.5° can be explained
                  by a recent passage of the system through a

                  through the secondary resonance, the system enters
                  the current Enceladus–Dione resonance close to tidal

                  heating of 1.1(18,000/QS) GW applies. We find that

                  involving Mimas, Enceladus, and/or Dione is studied
                  numerically with an averaged resonance model. We
                  find that, in the Enceladus–Dione 2:1 e-Enceladus

                  the current Enceladus–Dione resonance close to tidal

                  experiments now regularly observe binary black hole
                  mergers, the evolutionary origin of these events
                  remains a mystery. Analysis of the binary black hole
                  spin distribution may shed light on this mystery,
                  offering a means of discriminating between different
                  binary formation channels. Using the data from
                  Advanced LIGO and Virgo's first and second observing
                  runs, here we seek to carefully characterize the
                  distribution of effective spin among binary black
                  holes, hierarchically measuring the distribution's
                  mean \${\textbackslash}mu\$ and variance
                  \${\textbackslash}sigma{\textasciicircum}2\$ while
                  accounting for selection effects and degeneracies
                  between spin and other black hole parameters. We
                  demonstrate that the known population of binary
                  black holes have spins that are both small, with
                  \${\textbackslash}mu {\textbackslash}sim 0\$, and
                  very narrowly distributed, with

                  mergers, re-analyzing existing gravitational-wave
                  events with a population-informed prior on their
                  effective spin. The binary black hole GW170729,
                  which previously excluded effective spin equal to
                  zero, is now consistent with zero effective spin at
                  {\textasciitilde}10\% credibility. More broadly, we
                  find that uninformative spin priors generally yield

                  containing super-Earths and Neptunes in orbits of a
                  few days to a few months. There is debate whether in
                  situ assembly or inward migration is the dominant
                  mechanism of the formation of such planetary
                  systems. Simulations suggest that migration creates
                  tightly packed systems with planets whose orbital
                  periods may be expressed as ratios of small integers
                  (resonances), often in a many-planet series
                  (chain). In the hundreds of multi-planet systems of
                  sub-Neptunes, more planet pairs are observed near
                  resonances than would generally be expected, but no
                  individual system has hitherto been identified that
                  must have been formed by migration. Proximity to
                  resonance enables the detection of planets
                  perturbing each other. Here we report transit timing
                  variations of the four planets in the Kepler-223
                  system, model these variations as resonant-angle
                  librations, and compute the long-term stability of
                  the resonant chain. The architecture of Kepler-223
                  is too finely tuned to have been formed by
                  scattering, and our numerical simulations
                  demonstrate that its properties are natural outcomes
                  of the migration hypothesis. Similar systems could
                  be destabilized by any of several mechanisms,
                  contributing to the observed orbital-period
                  distribution, where many planets are not in
                  resonances. Planetesimal interactions in particular
                  are thought to be responsible for establishing the
                  current orbits of the four giant planets in the

  abstract =	 {Recent observations of protoplanetary disks, as well
                  as simulations of planet-disk interaction, have
                  suggested that a single planet may excite multiple
                  spiral arms in the disk, in contrast to the previous
                  expectations based on linear theory (predicting a
                  one-armed density wave). We re-assess the origin of
                  multiple arms in the framework of linear theory, by
                  solving for the global two-dimensional response of a
                  non-barotropic disk to an orbiting planet. We show
                  that the formation of a secondary arm in the inner
                  disk, at about half of the orbital radius of the
                  planet, is a robust prediction of linear
                  theory. This arm becomes stronger than the primary
                  spiral at several tenths of the orbital radius of
                  the planet. Several additional, weaker spiral arms
                  may also form in the inner disk. On the contrary, a
                  secondary spiral arm is unlikely to form in the
                  outer disk. Our linear calculations, fully
                  accounting for the global behavior of both the
                  phases and amplitudes of perturbations, generally
                  support the recently proposed WKB phase argument for
                  the secondary arm origin (as caused by the intricacy
                  of constructive interference of azimuthal harmonics
                  of the perturbation at different radii). We provide
                  analytical arguments showing that the process of a
                  single spiral wake splitting up into multiple arms
                  is a generic linear outcome of wave propagation in
                  differentially rotating disks. It is not unique to
                  planet-driven waves and occurs also in linear
                  calculations of spiral wakes freely propagating with
                  no external torques. These results are relevant for
                  understanding formation of multiple rings and gaps

  abstract =	 {Gravitational coupling between young planets and
                  their parent disks is often explored using numerical
                  simulations, which typically treat the disk
                  thermodynamics in a highly simplified manner. In
                  particular, many studies adopt the locally
                  isothermal approximation, in which the disk
                  temperature is a fixed function of the stellocentric
                  distance. We explore the dynamics of planet-driven
                  density waves in disks with more general
                  thermodynamics, in which the temperature is relaxed
                  towards an equilibrium profile on a finite cooling
                  timescale \$t\_\{{\textbackslash}rm c\}\$. We use
                  both linear perturbation theory and direct numerical
                  simulations to examine the global structure of
                  density waves launched by planets in such disks. A
                  key diagnostic used in this study is the behavior of
                  the wave angular momentum flux (AMF), which directly
                  determines the evolution of the underlying disk. The
                  AMF of free waves is constant for slowly cooling
                  (adiabatic) disks, but scales with the disk
                  temperature for rapidly cooling (and locally
                  isothermal) disks. However, cooling must be
                  extremely fast, with \${\textbackslash}beta =
                  {\textbackslash}Omega t\_\{{\textbackslash}rm c\}
                  {\textbackslash}lesssim 10{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$
                  for the locally isothermal approximation to provide
                  a good description of density wave dynamics in the
                  linear regime (relaxing to \${\textbackslash}beta
                  {\textbackslash}lesssim 10{\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$
                  when nonlinear effects are important). For
                  intermediate cooling timescales, density waves are
                  subject to a strong linear damping. This modifies
                  the appearance of planet-driven spiral arms and the
                  characteristics of axisymmetric structures produced
                  by massive planets: in disks with
                  \${\textbackslash}beta {\textbackslash}approx 0.1\$
                  -- \$1\$, a near-thermal mass planet opens only a
                  single wide gap around its orbit, in contrast to the
                  several narrow gaps produced when cooling is either
                  faster or slower.},

                  concentric rings and gaps discovered by ALMA in many
                  protoplanetary disks may be produced by a single
                  planet, as a result of the complex propagation and
                  dissipation of the multiple spiral density waves it
                  excites in the disk. Numerical efforts to verify
                  this idea have largely utilized the so-called
                  locally isothermal approximation with a prescribed
                  disk temperature profile. However, in protoplanetary
                  disks this approximation does not provide an
                  accurate description of the density wave dynamics on
                  scales of tens of astronomical units. Moreover, we
                  show that locally isothermal simulations tend to
                  overestimate the contrast of ring and gap features,
                  as well as misrepresent their positions, when
                  compared to simulations in which the energy equation
                  is evolved explicitly. This outcome is caused by the
                  nonconservation of the angular momentum flux of
                  linear perturbations in locally isothermal disks. We
                  demonstrate this effect using simulations of locally
                  isothermal and adiabatic disks (with essentially
                  identical temperature profiles) and show how the
                  dust distributions, probed by millimeter wavelength
                  observations, differ between the two cases. Locally
                  isothermal simulations may thus underestimate the
                  masses of planets responsible for the formation of
                  multiple gaps and rings on scales of tens of
                  astronomical units observed by ALMA. We suggest that
                  caution should be exercised in using the locally
                  isothermal simulations to explore planet–disk
                  interaction, as well as in other studies of

                  M\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$) planet near the inner
                  edge of a protoplanetary disc using two-dimensional
                  viscous hydrodynamics simulations. We employ an
                  inner boundary condition representing the truncation
                  of the disc at the stellar corotation radius. As
                  described by Tsang (2011), wave reflection at the
                  inner disc boundary modifies the Type I migration
                  torque on the planet, allowing migration to be
                  halted before the planet reaches the inner edge of
                  the disc. For low-viscosity discs
                  (\${\textbackslash}alpha {\textbackslash}lesssim
                  10{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$), planets may be
                  trapped with semi-major axes as large as \$3-5\$
                  times the inner disc radius. In general, planets are
                  trapped closer to the inner edge as either the
                  planet mass or the disc viscosity parameter
                  \${\textbackslash}alpha\$ increases, and farther
                  from the inner edge as the disc thickness is
                  increased. This planet trapping mechanism may impact
                  the formation and migration history of close-in
                  compact multiplanet systems.},

                  scattered by dust particles at the disk surface in

                  {\textless}= r {\textless}= 174 AU, is successfully
                  detected. The azimuthally-averaged radial profile of
                  the PI shows a double power-law distribution, in
                  which the PIs in r=29-52 AU and r=81.2-145 AU
                  respectively show
                  r{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}-dependence. These two
                  power-law regions are connected smoothly with a
                  transition zone (TZ), exhibiting an apparent gap in
                  r=40-70 AU. The PI in the inner power-law region
                  shows a deep minimum whose location seems to
                  coincide with the point source at
                  {\textbackslash}lambda = 7 mm. This can be regarded
                  as another sign of a protoplanet in TZ. The observed
                  radial profile of the PI is reproduced by a
                  minimally flaring disk with an irregular surface
                  density distribution or with an irregular
                  temperature distribution or with the combination of
                  both. The depletion factor of surface density in the
                  inner power-law region (r{\textless} 50 AU) is
                  derived to be {\textless}= 0.16 from a simple model
                  calculation. The obtained PI image also shows small
                  scale asymmetries in the outer power-law
                  region. Possible origins for these asymmetries
                  include corrugation of the scattering surface in the
                  outer region, and shadowing effect by a puffed up
                  structure in the inner power-law region.},

                  motion resonances have often been hailed as a
                  signpost of disk-driven migration. Resonant chains
                  like Kepler-223 and Kepler-80 consist of a trio of
                  planets with the three-body resonant angle librating
                  and/or with a two-body resonant angle librating for
                  each pair. Here we investigate whether close-in
                  super-Earths and mini-Neptunes forming in situ can
                  lock into resonant chains due to dissipation from a
                  depleted gas disk. We simulate the giant impact
                  phase of planet formation, including eccentricity
                  damping from a gaseous disk, followed by subsequent
                  dynamical evolution over tens of millions of
                  years. In a fraction of simulated systems, we find
                  that planets naturally lock into resonant
                  chains. These planets achieve a chain of
                  near-integer period ratios during the gas-disk
                  stage, experience eccentricity damping that captures
                  them into resonance, stay in resonance as the gas
                  disk dissipates, and avoid subsequent giant impacts,
                  eccentricity excitation, and chaotic diffusion that
                  would dislodge the planets from resonance. Disk
                  conditions that enable planets to complete their
                  formation during the gas-disk stage enable those
                  planets to achieve tight period ratios ≤2 and, if
                  they happen to be near-integer period ratios, lock
                  into resonance. Using the weighting of different
                  disk conditions deduced by MacDonald et al. and
                  forward modeling Kepler selection effects, we find
                  that our simulations of in situ formation via
                  oligarchic growth lead to a rate of observable trios
                  with integer period ratios and librating resonant
                  angles comparable to observed Kepler systems.},

                  disks are a common feature and support the presence
                  of warps or misalignments between disk
                  regions. These warps are possibly due to an inclined
                  (sub-)stellar companion embedded in the disk. We
                  study the morphology of the protoplanetary disk
                  around the Herbig Ae star HD 139614 based on the
                  first scattered light observations of this disk,
                  which we model with the radiative transfer code
                  MCMax3D. We obtained J- and H-band observations in
                  polarized scattered light with VLT/SPHERE that show
                  strong azimuthal asymmetries. In the outer disk,
                  beyond {\textasciitilde}30 au, a broad shadow spans
                  a range of
                  {\textasciitilde}240\{{\textbackslash}deg\} in
                  position angle, in the East. A bright ring at
                  {\textasciitilde}16 au also shows an azimuthally
                  asymmetric brightness, with the faintest side
                  roughly coincidental with the brightest region of
                  the outer disk. Additionally, two arcs are detected
                  at {\textasciitilde}34 au and {\textasciitilde}50
                  au. We created a simple 4-zone approximation to a
                  warped disk model of HD 139614 in order to
                  qualitatively reproduce these features. The location
                  and misalignment of the disk components were
                  constrained from the shape and location of the
                  shadows they cast. We find that the shadow on the
                  outer disk covers a range of position angle too wide
                  to be explained by a single inner misaligned
                  component. Our model requires a minimum of two
                  separate misaligned zones -- or a continuously
                  warped region -- to cast this broad shadow on the
                  outer disk. A small misalignment of
                  {\textasciitilde}4\{{\textbackslash}deg\} between
                  adjacent components can reproduce most of the
                  observed shadow features. Multiple misaligned disk
                  zones, potentially mimicing a warp, can explain the
                  observed broad shadows in the HD 139614 disk. A
                  planetary mass companion in the disk, located on an
                  inclined orbit, could be responsible for such a
                  feature and for the dust depleted gap responsible
                  for a dip in the SED.},

                  for a number of the sub-structures frequently
                  observed in disks in both scattered light and dust
                  thermal emission. Despite the ubiquity of these

                  spiral arms within planetary gaps still remain

                  results in the context of hydrodynamical simulations
                  in order to infer the properties of a putative
                  embedded planet in the cavity of a transition

                  datasets with existing band 9 (430um) and band 7
                  (870um) ALMA continuum data. The Band 3 continuum
                  data reveals a large cavity and a bright ring
                  peaking at 53 au strongly suggestive of dust
                  trapping.The ring shows a pronounced azimuthal
                  asymmetry, with a bright region in the north-west
                  that we interpret as a dust over-density. A
                  similarly-asymmetric ring is revealed at the same
                  location in polarized scattered light, in addition

                  ring. These features are consistent with a number of
                  previous hydrodynamical models of planet-disk
                  interactions, and suggest the presence of a
                  {\textasciitilde}1 MJup planet at 44 au and

                  which the location of a putative planet can be
                  precisely inferred. With the location of a possible
                  planet being well-constrained by observations, it is
                  an ideal candidate for follow-up observations to
                  search for direct evidence of a planetary companion
                  still embedded in its disk.},

                  objects (ETNOs) has been attributed to the
                  gravitational effects of an unseen 5-10 Earth-mass
                  planet in the outer solar system. To investigate how

                  consider 14 ETNOs discovered by the Dark Energy
                  Survey, the Outer Solar System Origins Survey, and
                  the survey of Sheppard and Trujillo. Using each

  abstract =	 {We use N-body simulations to investigate the
                  structure of dark halos in the standard cold dark
                  matter cosmogony. Halos are excised from simulations
                  of cosmologically representative regions and are
                  resimulated individually at high resolution. We
                  study objects with masses ranging from those of
                  dwarf galaxy halos to those of rich galaxy
                  clusters. The spherically averaged density profiles
                  of all our halos can be fitted over two decades in
                  radius by scaling a simple "universal" profile. The
                  characteristic over- density of a halo, or
                  equivalently its concentration, correlates strongly
                  with halo mass in a way that reflects the mass
                  dependence of the epoch of halo formation. Halo
                  profiles are approximately isothermal over a large
                  range in radii but are significantly shallower than
                  r -2 near the center and steeper than r-2 near the
                  virial radius. Matching the observed rotation curves
                  of disk galaxies requires disk mass-to-light ratios
                  to increase systematically with luminosity. Further,
                  it suggests that the halos of bright galaxies depend
                  only weakly on galaxy luminosity and have circular
                  velocities significantly lower than the disk
                  rotation speed. This may explain why luminosity and
                  dynamics are uncorrelated in observed samples of
                  binary galaxies and of satellite/spiral systems. For
                  galaxy clusters, our halo models are consistent both
                  with the presence of giant arcs and with the
                  observed structure of the intracluster medium, and
                  they suggest a simple explanation for the disparate
                  estimates of cluster core radii found by previous
                  authors. Our results also highlight two shortcomings
                  of the CDM model. CDM halos are too concentrated to
                  be consistent with the halo parameters inferred for
                  dwarf irregulars, and the predicted abundance of
                  galaxy halos is larger than the observed abundance
                  of galaxies. The first problem may imply that the
                  core structure of dwarf galaxies was altered by the
                  galaxy formation process, and the second problem may
                  imply that galaxies failed to form (or remain
                  undetected) in many dark halos.},

                  halos in hierarchically clustering universes. We
                  find that all such profiles have the same shape,
                  independent of the halo mass, the initial density
                  fluctuation spectrum, and the values of the
                  cosmological parameters. Spherically averaged
                  equilibrium profiles are well fitted over two
                  decades in radius by a simple formula originally
                  proposed to describe the structure of galaxy
                  clusters in a cold dark matter universe. In any
                  particular cosmology, the two scale parameters of
                  the fit, the halo mass and its characteristic
                  density, are strongly correlated. Low-mass halos are
                  significantly denser than more massive systems, a
                  correlation that reflects the higher collapse
                  redshift of small halos. The characteristic density
                  of an equilibrium halo is proportional to the
                  density of the universe at the time it was
                  assembled. A suitable definition of this assembly
                  time allows the same proportionality constant to be
                  used for all the cosmologies that we have tested. We

                  density profiles and show that there is good
                  agreement. We also provide a step-by-step analytic
                  procedure, based on the Press-Schechter formalism,
                  that allows accurate equilibrium profiles to be

                  a diagnostic of gravitational interactions between

                  Objects of Interest (KOIs) exhibit significant TTVs,
                  but KOI-142.01 stands out among them with an

                  discover periodic transit duration variations (TDVs)
                  of KOI-142.01 that are nearly in phase with the

                  of two inner terrestrial planets near mean motion
                  resonance (MMRs) induced by the perturbation of a
                  distant gas-giant for the Kepler-68 system, by
                  conducting thousands of numerical simulations. The
                  results show that the formation of terrestrial
                  planets is relevant to the speed of Type I
                  migration, the mass of planets, and the existence of
                  giant planet. The mass and eccentricity of the giant
                  planet may play a crucial role in shaping the final
                  configuration of the system. The inner planet pair
                  can be trapped in 5:3 or 7:4 MMRs if the giant
                  planet revolves the central star with an eccentric
                  orbit, which is similar to the observed
                  configuration of Kepler-68. Moreover, we find that
                  the eccentricity of the middle planet can be excited
                  to roughly 0.2 if the giant planet is more massive
                  than 5 \$M\_J\$,otherwise the terrestrial planets
                  are inclined to remain near-circular orbits. Our
                  study may provide a likely formation scenario for
                  the planetary systems that harbor several
                  terrestrial planets near MMRs inside and one
                  gas-giant exterior to them.},

  abstract =	 {We know little about the outermost exoplanets in
                  planetary systems, because our detection methods are
                  insensitive to moderate-mass planets on wide orbits.
                  However, debris discs can probe the outer-planet
                  population, because dynamical modelling of observed
                  discs can reveal properties of perturbing
                  planets. We use four sculpting and stirring
                  arguments to infer planet properties in 178
                  debris-disc systems from the ISPY, LEECH and LIStEN
                  planet-hunting surveys.  Similar analyses are often
                  conducted for individual discs, but we consider a
                  large sample in a consistent manner. We aim to
                  predict the population of wide-separation planets,
                  gain insight into the formation and evolution
                  histories of planetary systems, and determine the
                  feasibility of detecting these planets in the near
                  future. We show that a `typical' cold debris disc
                  likely requires a Neptune- to Saturn-mass planet at
                  10-100 au, with some needing Jupiter-mass
                  perturbers. Our predicted planets are currently
                  undetectable, but modest detection-limit
                  improvements (e.g. from JWST) should reveal many
                  such perturbers. We find that planets thought to be
                  perturbing debris discs at late times are similar to
                  those inferred to be forming in protoplanetary
                  discs, so these could be the same population if
                  newly formed planets do not migrate as far as
                  currently thought. Alternatively, young planets
                  could rapidly sculpt debris before migrating
                  inwards, meaning that the responsible planets are
                  more massive (and located further inwards) than
                  debris-disc studies assume. We combine self-stirring
                  and size-distribution modelling to show that many
                  debris discs cannot be self-stirred without having
                  unreasonably high masses; planet- or
                  companion-stirring may therefore be the dominant
                  mechanism in many (perhaps all) debris
                  discs. Finally, we provide catalogues of planet
                  predictions, and identify promising targets for
                  future planet searches.},

                  whose gravitational effect approximates that of
                  Einstein's cosmological constant, Lambda; nowadays
                  the concept is termed dark energy or
                  quintessence. Physics also suggests the dark energy
                  could be dynamical, allowing the arguably appealing
                  picture that the dark energy density is evolving to
                  its natural value, zero, and is small now because
                  the expanding universe is old. This alleviates the
                  classical problem of the curious energy scale of
                  order a millielectronvolt associated with a constant
                  Lambda. Dark energy may have been detected by recent
                  advances in the cosmological tests. The tests
                  establish a good scientific case for the context, in
                  the relativistic Friedmann-Lemaitre model, including
                  the gravitational inverse square law applied to the
                  scales of cosmology. We have well-checked evidence
                  that the mean mass density is not much more than one
                  quarter of the critical Einstein-de Sitter
                  value. The case for detection of dark energy is
                  serious but not yet as convincing; we await more
                  checks that may come out of work in
                  progress. Planned observations might be capable of
                  detecting evolution of the dark energy density; a
                  positive result would be a considerable stimulus to
                  attempts to understand the microphysics of dark
                  energy. This review presents the basic physics and
                  astronomy of the subject, reviews the history of
                  ideas, assesses the state of the observational
                  evidence, and comments on recent developments in the

                  parametrize viscosity with the dimensionless
                  parameter alpha. There is no detailed model for
                  alpha, so it is usually taken to be a
                  constant. However, global simulations of
                  magnetohydrodynamic disks find that alpha varies
                  with distance from the central object. Also,
                  Newtonian simulations tend to find smaller alpha's
                  than general relativistic simulations. We seek a
                  one-dimensional model for alpha that can reproduce
                  these two observations. We are guided by data from
                  six general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic
                  accretion disk simulations. The variation of alpha
                  in the inner, laminar regions of the flow results
                  from stretching of mean magnetic field lines by the
                  flow. The variation of alpha in the outer, turbulent
                  regions results from the dependence of the
                  magnetorotational instability on the dimensionless
                  shear rate. We give a one-dimensional prescription
                  for alpha(r) that captures these two effects and
                  reproduces the radial variation of alpha observed in
                  the simulations. For thin disks, the prescription
                  simplifies to the formula
                  alpha(r)=0.025[q(r)/1.5]{\textasciicircum}6, where
                  the shear parameter, q(r), is an analytical function
                  of radius in the Kerr metric. The coefficient and
                  exponent are inferred from our simulations and will
                  change as better simulation data becomes
                  available. We conclude that the alpha-viscosity
                  prescription can be extended to the radially varying
                  alpha's observed in simulations. It is possible that
                  Newtonian simulations find smaller alpha's than
                  general relativistic simulations because the shear
                  parameter is lower in Newtonian flows.},

                  observations of the disk around the T-Tauri star HD
                  143006, which at 46 mas (7.6 au) resolution reveal
                  new substructures in the 1.25 mm continuum
                  emission. The disk resolves into a series of
                  concentric rings and gaps together with a bright arc
                  exterior to the rings that resembles hydrodynamics
                  simulations of a vortex, and a bridge-like feature
                  connecting the two innermost rings. Although our
                  \${\textasciicircum}\{12\}\$CO observations at
                  similar spatial resolution do not show obvious
                  substructure, they reveal an inner disk depleted of
                  CO emission. From the continuum emission and the CO
                  velocity field we find that the innermost ring has a
                  higher inclination than the outermost rings and the
                  arc. This is evidence for either a small
                  (\${\textbackslash}sim8{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\}\$)

                  protoplanetary disks, yet their possible connection
                  to planet formation is currently subject to intense
                  debates. In principle, giant planet formation leads
                  to wide gaps that separate the gas and dust mass
                  reservoir in the outer disk, while lower mass
                  planets lead to shallow gaps that are manifested
                  mainly on the dust component. We used the Atacama
                  Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) to
                  observe the star HD 169142, host to a prominent disk
                  with deep, wide gaps that sever the disk into inner
                  and outer regions. The new ALMA high-resolution
                  images allow for the outer ring to be resolved as
                  three narrow rings. The HD 169142 disk thus hosts
                  both the wide gap trait of transition disks and a
                  narrow-ring system similar to those observed in the
                  TW Hya and HL Tau systems. The mass reservoir beyond
                  a deep gap can thus host ring systems. The observed
                  rings are narrow in radial extent (width/radius of
                  1.5/57.3, 1.8/64.2, and 3.4/76.0 in au) and have
                  asymmetric mutual separations: the first and middle
                  ring are separated by 7 au while the middle and
                  outermost ring are distanced by ∼12 au. Using
                  hydrodynamical modeling we found that a simple
                  explanation, involving a single migrating low-mass
                  planet (10 M ⊕), entirely accounts for such an
                  apparently complex phenomenon. Inward migration of
                  the planet naturally explains the ring’s asymmetric
                  mutual separation. The isolation of HD 169142's
                  outer rings thus allows a proof of concept to
                  interpret the detailed architecture of the outer
                  region of protoplanetary disks with low-mass planet
                  formation of mini-Neptune’s size, i.e., as in the

                  contrast with the physical and orbital properties of
                  the solar system planets. The planets are between
                  the size of Uranus and Saturn at 7.0 ± 0.2
                  \{R\}{\textbackslash}oplus and 4.1 ± 0.2
                  \{R\}{\textbackslash}oplus , respectively, and
                  reside a mere 0.1\% outside the nominal 3:2
                  mean-motion resonance. They represent a different
                  outcome of the planet formation process than the
                  solar system, as well as the vast majority of known
                  exoplanets. We measured the physical and orbital
                  properties of these planets using photometry from
                  K2, Spitzer, and ground-based telescopes, along with
                  radial velocities from Keck/HIRES. Through a joint
                  photodynamical model, we found that the planets have
                  moderate eccentricities of e ≈ 0.20 and well-aligned
                  apsides Δϖ ≈ 0°. The planets occupy a strictly
                  nonresonant configuration: the resonant angles
                  circulate rather than librate. This defies the
                  predictions of standard formation pathways that
                  invoke convergent or divergent migration, both of
                  which predict Δϖ ≈ 180° and eccentricities of a few
                  percent or less.  We measured masses of M p,b = 32.4
                  ± 1.7 \{M\}{\textbackslash}oplus and M p,c = 10.8 ±
                  0.6 \{M\}{\textbackslash}oplus . Our measurements,
                  with 5\% fractional uncertainties, are among the
                  most precise of any sub-Jovian exoplanet.  Mass and
                  size reflect a planet’s core/envelope
                  structure. Despite having a relatively massive core
                  of \{M\vphantom{\{}\}core\} ≈ 15
                  \{M\}{\textbackslash}oplus , K2-19b is
                  envelope-rich, with an envelope mass fraction of
                  roughly 50\%. This planet poses a challenge to
                  standard models of core-nucleated accretion, which
                  predict that cores ≳10 \{M\}{\textbackslash}oplus
                  will quickly accrete gas and trigger runaway
                  accretion when the envelope mass exceeds that of the

                  understanding the details of the dynamics of planet
                  formation and evolution. While the dynamics of
                  two-planet MMRs are well understood and
                  approximately described by a one degree of freedom
                  Hamiltonian, little is known of the exact dynamics
                  of three-bodies resonances besides the cases of
                  zeroth-order MMRs or when one of the body is a test
                  particle. In this work, I propose the first general
                  integrable model for first-order three-planet mean

                  the strategy proposed in the two-planet case to
                  obtain a one degree of freedom Hamiltonian. The
                  dynamics of these resonances are governed by the
                  second fundamental model of resonance.  The model is
                  valid for any mass ratio between the planets and for
                  every first-order resonance. I show the agreement of
                  the analytical model with numerical simulations. As
                  examples of application I show how this model could

                  Transit-Timing Variations (TTVs) suggested b and c
                  are close to but not in 3:2 mean motion resonance
                  (MMR) because the classical resonant angles
                  circulate. Such an architecture challenges our
                  understanding of planet formation. Indeed, planet
                  migration through the protoplanetary disk should
                  lead to a capture into the MMR. Here, we show that
                  the planets are in fact, locked into the 3:2
                  resonance despite circulation of the conventional
                  resonant angles and aligned periapses. However, we
                  show that such an orbital configuration cannot be
                  maintained for more than a few hundred million years
                  due to the tidal dissipation experienced by planet
                  d. The tidal dissipation remains efficient because
                  of a secular forcing of the innermost planet
                  eccentricity by planets b and c. While the
                  observations strongly rule out an orbital solution
                  where the three planets are on close to circular
                  orbits, it remains possible that a fourth planet is
                  affecting the TTVs such that the four planet system
                  is consistent with the tidal constraints.},

  abstract =	 {The recent characterization of transiting close-in
                  planets has revealed an intriguing population of
                  sub-Neptunes with highly tilted and even polar
                  orbits relative to their host star’s equator. Any
                  viable theory for the origin of these close-in,
                  polar planets must explain (1) the observed stellar
                  obliquities, (2) the substantial eccentricities, and
                  (3) the existence of Jovian companions with large
                  mutual inclinations. In this work, we propose a
                  theoretical model that satisﬁes these requirements
                  without invoking tidal dissipation or large
                  primordial inclinations. Instead, tilting is
                  facilitated by the protoplanetary disk dispersal
                  during the late stage of planet formation,
                  initiating a process of resonance sweeping and
                  parametric instability. This mechanism consists of
                  two steps. First, a nodal secular resonance excites
                  the inclination to large values; then, once the
                  inclination reaches a critical value, a linear
                  eccentric instability is triggered, which detunes
                  the resonance and ends inclination growth. The
                  critical inclination is pushed to high values by
                  general relativistic precession, making polar orbits
                  an inherently post-Newtonian outcome. Our model
                  predicts that polar, close-in subNeptunes coexist
                  with cold Jupiters in low stellar obliquity orbits.},

  abstract =	 {Aims: We attempt to explain grain growth to mm sized
                  particles and their retention in the outer regions
                  of protoplanetary disks, as observed at sub-mm and
                  mm wavelengths, by investigating whether strong
                  inhomogeneities in the gas density profiles can
                  decelerate excessive radial drift and help the dust
                  particles to grow. Methods: We use
                  coagulation/fragmentation and disk-structure models,
                  to simulate the evolution of dust in a bumpy surface
                  density profile, which we mimic with a sinusoidal
                  disturbance. For different values of the amplitude
                  and length scale of the bumps, we investigate the
                  ability of this model to produce and retain large
                  particles on million-year timescales. In addition,
                  we compare the pressure inhomogeneities considered
                  in this work with the pressure profiles that come
                  from magnetorotational instability. Using the Common
                  Astronomy Software Applications ALMA simulator, we
                  study whether there are observational signatures of
                  these pressure inhomogeneities that can be seen with
                  ALMA. Results: We present the conditions required to
                  trap dust particles and the corresponding
                  calculations predicting the spectral slope in the
                  mm-wavelength range, to compare with current
                  observations. Finally, we present simulated images
                  using different antenna configurations of ALMA at
                  different frequencies, to show that the ring
                  structures will be detectable at the distances of

                  and observability of the inner systems. We present a

                  influence of an eccentric, misaligned outer
                  perturber. Analytic results are derived for the
                  inner planet eccentricities (ei) and mutual
                  inclination (θ12) of the `two-planet + perturber'
                  system, calibrated with numerical secular and N-body
                  integrations, as a function of the perturber mass
                  mp, semimajor axis ap, and inclination angle θp. We
                  find that the dynamics of the inner system is
                  determined by the dimensionless parameter ɛ12, given
                  by the ratio between the differential precession
                  rate driven by the perturber and the mutual
                  precession rate of the inner planets. Loosely packed
                  systems (corresponding to ɛ12 ≫ 1) are more
                  susceptible to eccentricity/inclination excitations
                  by the perturber than tightly packed inner systems
                  (with ɛ12 ≪ 1) (or singletons), although resonance
                  may occur around ɛ12 ∼ 1, leading to large ei and
                  θ12. Dynamical instability may set in for inner
                  planet systems with large excited eccentricities and
                  mutual inclinations. We present a formalism to

                  {\textbackslash}lesssim 0.5\$ au) super-Earth and
                  mini-Neptune systems and their outer (\$a
                  {\textbackslash}gtrsim\$ a few au) giant planet
                  companions. We study the dynamical evolution of such
                  inner systems subject to the gravitational effect of
                  an unstable system of outer giant planets, focussing
                  on systems whose end configurations feature only a
                  single remaining outer giant. In contrast to similar
                  studies which used on N-body simulations with
                  specific (and limited) parameters or scenarios, we
                  implement a novel hybrid algorithm which combines
                  N-body simulations with secular dynamics with aims
                  of obtaining analytical understanding and scaling
                  relations. We find that the dynamical evolution of
                  the inner planet system depends crucially on
                  \$N\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{ej\}\}\$, the number
                  of mutual close encounters between the outer planets
                  prior to eventual ejection/merger. When
                  \$N\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{ej\}\}\$ is small,
                  the eventual evolution of the inner planets can be
                  well described by secular dynamics. For larger
                  values of \$N\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{ej\}\}\$,
                  the inner planets gain orbital inclination,
                  inclination and eccentricity in a stochastic fashion
                  analogous to Brownian motion. We develop a
                  theoretical model, and compute scaling laws for the
                  final orbital parameters of the inner system. We
                  show that our model can account for the observed
                  eccentric super-Earths/mini-Neptunes with inclined
                  cold Jupiter companions, such as HAT-P-11, Gliese

                  tidal interaction is considered. Density waves
                  launched by the planet are assumed to be damped as a
                  result of their nonlinear evolution leading to shock
                  formation and its subsequent dissipation. As a
                  consequence, wave angular momentum is transferred to
                  the disk, leading to evolution of its surface
                  density. Planetary migration is an important
                  ingredient of the theory; effects of the
                  planet-induced surface density perturbations on the
                  migration speed are considered. A gap is assumed to
                  form when a stationary solution for the surface
                  density profile is no longer possible in the frame
                  of reference migrating with the planet. An
                  analytical limit on the planetary mass necessary to
                  open a gap in an inviscid disk is derived. The
                  critical mass turns out to be smaller than the mass
                  M1 for which the planetary Hill radius equals the
                  disk scale height by a factor of at least Q5/7 (Q is
                  the Toomre stability parameter), depending on the
                  strength of the migration feedback. In viscous disks
                  the critical planetary mass could vary from
                  {\textasciitilde}0.2M1 to M1, depending on the disk
                  viscosity. This implies that a gap could be formed
                  by a planet with mass of 2-15 M⊕, depending on the
                  disk aspect ratio, viscosity, and the planet's

abstract = {Idealized protoplanetary disk and giant planet formation models have been interpreted to suggest that a giant planet's atmospheric abundances can be used to infer its formation location in its parent protoplanetary disk. It has recently been reported that the hot Jupiter WASP-77 A b has sub-solar atmospheric carbon and oxygen abundances with a solar C/O abundance ratio. Assuming solar carbon and oxygen abundances for its host star WASP-77 A, WASP-77 A b's atmospheric carbon and oxygen abundances possibly indicate that it accreted its envelope interior to its parent protoplanetary disk's H2O ice line from carbon-depleted gas with little subsequent planetesimal accretion or core erosion. We comprehensively model WASP-77 A and use our results to better characterize WASP-77 A b. We show that the photospheric abundances of carbon and oxygen in WASP-77 A are super-solar with a sub-solar C/O abundance ratio, implying that WASP-77 A b's atmosphere has significantly sub-stellar carbon and oxygen abundances with a super-stellar C/O ratio. Our result possibly indicates that WASP-77 A b's envelope was accreted by the planet beyond its parent protoplanetary disk's H2O ice line. While numerous theoretical complications to these idealized models have now been identified, the possibility of non-solar protoplanetary disk abundance ratios confound even the most sophisticated protoplanetary disk and giant planet formation models. We therefore argue that giant planet atmospheric abundance ratios can only be meaningfully interpreted relative to the possibly non-solar mean compositions of their parent protoplanetary disks as recorded in the photospheric abundances of their solar-type dwarf host stars.},

  abstract =	 {The reproducibility of experiments is one of the
                  main principles of the scientific method. However,
                  numerical N-body experiments, especially those of
                  planetary systems, are currently not
                  reproducible. In the most optimistic scenario, they
                  can only be replicated in an approximate or
                  statistical sense. Even if authors share their full
                  source code and initial conditions, differences in
                  compilers, libraries, operating systems or hardware
                  often lead to qualitatively different results. We
                  provide a new set of easy-to-use, open-source tools
                  that address the above issues, allowing for exact
                  (bit-by-bit) reproducibility of N-body
                  experiments. In addition to generating completely
                  reproducible integrations, we show that our
                  framework also offers novel and innovative ways to
                  analyse these simulations. As an example, we present
                  a high-accuracy integration of the Solar system
                  spanning 10 Gyr, requiring several weeks to run on a
                  modern CPU. In our framework, we can not only easily
                  access simulation data at predefined intervals for
                  which we save snapshots, but at any time during the
                  integration. We achieve this by integrating an
                  on-demand reconstructed simulation forward in time
                  from the nearest snapshot. This allows us to extract
                  arbitrary quantities at any point in the saved
                  simulation exactly (bit-by-bit), and within seconds
                  rather than weeks. We believe that the tools we
                  present in this paper offer a new paradigm for how
                  N-body simulations are run, analysed and shared
                  across the community.},

                  freely available under an open-source license. It
                  was designed for collisional dynamics such as
                  planetary rings but can also solve the classical
                  N-body problem. It is highly modular and can be
                  customized easily to work on a wide variety of
                  different problems in astrophysics and
                  beyond. REBOUND comes with three symplectic
                  integrators: leap-frog, the symplectic epicycle
                  integrator (SEI) and a Wisdom-Holman mapping
                  (WH). It supports open, periodic and shearing-sheet
                  boundary conditions. REBOUND can use a Barnes-Hut
                  tree to calculate both self-gravity and
                  collisions. These modules are fully parallelized
                  with MPI as well as OpenMP. The former makes use of
                  a static domain decomposition and a distributed
                  essential tree. Two new collision detection modules
                  based on a plane-sweep algorithm are also
                  implemented. The performance of the plane-sweep
                  algorithm is superior to a tree code for simulations
                  in which one dimension is much longer than the other
                  two and in simulations which are quasi-two
                  dimensional with less than one million particles. In
                  this work, we discuss the different algorithms
                  implemented in REBOUND, the philosophy behind the
                  code's structure as well as implementation specific
                  details of the different modules. We present results
                  of accuracy and scaling tests which show that the
                  code can run efficiently on both desktop machines
                  and large computing clusters.},

  abstract =	 {Present and upcoming time-domain astronomy efforts,
                  in part driven by gravitational-wave follow-up
                  campaigns, will unveil a variety of rare explosive
                  transients in the sky. Here, we focus on pulsational
                  pair-instability evolution, which can result in
                  signatures that are observable with electromagnetic
                  and gravitational waves. We simulated grids of bare
                  helium stars to characterize the resulting black
                  hole (BH) masses together with the ejecta
                  composition, velocity, and thermal state. We find
                  that the stars do not react "elastically" to the
                  thermonuclear ignition in the core: there is not a
                  one-to-one correspondence between pair-instability
                  driven ignition and mass ejections, which causes
                  ambiguity as to what is an observable pulse. In
                  agreement with previous studies, we find that for
                  initial helium core masses of 37.5 M⊙ ≲ MHe, init ≲
                  41 M⊙, corresponding to carbon-oxygen core masses
                  27.5 M⊙ ≲ MCO ≲ 30.1 M⊙, the explosions are not
                  strong enough to affect the surface. With increasing
                  initial helium core mass, they become progressively
                  stronger causing first large radial expansion (41 M⊙
                  ≲ MHe, init ≲ 42 M⊙, corresponding to 30.1 M⊙ ≲ MCO
                  ≲ 30.8 M⊙) and, finally, also mass ejection episodes
                  (for MHe, init ≳ 42 M⊙, or MCO ≳ 30.8 M⊙). The
                  lowest mass helium core to be fully disrupted in a
                  pair-instability supernova is MHe, init ≃ 80 M⊙,
                  corresponding to MCO ≃ 55 M⊙. Models with MHe, init
                  ≳ 200 M⊙ (MCO ≳ 114 M⊙) reach the
                  photodisintegration regime, resulting in BHs with
                  masses of MBH ≳ 125 M⊙. Although this is currently
                  considered unlikely, if BHs from these models form
                  via (weak) explosions, the previously-ejected
                  material might be hit by the blast wave and convert
                  kinetic energy into observable electromagnetic
                  radiation. We characterize the hydrogen-free
                  circumstellar material from the pulsational
                  pair-instability of helium cores by simply assuming
                  that the ejecta maintain a constant velocity after
                  ejection. We find that our models produce
                  helium-rich ejecta with mass of 10-3 M⊙ ≲ MCSM ≲ 40
                  M⊙, the larger values corresponding to the more
                  massive progenitor stars.  These ejecta are
                  typically launched at a few thousand km s-1 and
                  reach distances of ∼1012 - 1015 cm before the
                  core-collapse of the star. The delays between mass
                  ejection events and the final collapse span a wide
                  and mass-dependent range (from subhour to 104
                  years), and the shells ejected can also collide with
                  each other, powering supernova impostor events
                  before the final core-collapse. The range of
                  properties we find suggests a possible connection
                  with (some) type Ibn supernovae.},

                  challenges this scenario faces to form one BH in the

                  during the merger, and the merger product needs to
                  retain enough mass, including in the subsequent
                  evolution, and at core-collapse. We explore this
                  scenario with detailed stellar evolution
                  calculations, starting with ad-hoc initial
                  conditions enforcing no core growth during the

  abstract =	 {The discovery of ’Oumuamua (1I/2017 U1), the ﬁrst
                  interstellar interloper, suggests an abundance of
                  free-ﬂoating small bodies whose ejection into
                  galactic space cannot be explained by the current
                  population of conﬁrmed exoplanets. Shortly after
                  ’Oumuamua’s discovery, observational results from
                  the DSHARP survey illustrated the near-ubiquity of
                  ring/gap substructures within protoplanetary disks,
                  strongly suggesting the existence of a vast
                  population of as-yet undetected wide-separation
                  planets that are capable of eﬃciently ejecting
                  debris from their environments. These planets have a
                  5 au and masses of order Neptune’s or larger, and
                  they may accompany ∼50\% of newly formed stars
                  (Zhang et al. 2018). We combine the DSHARP results
                  with statistical constraints from current timedomain
                  surveys to quantify the population of detectable icy
                  planetesimals ejected by disk-embedded giant planets
                  through gravity assists. Assessment of the expected
                  statistical distribution of interstellar objects is
                  critical to accurately plan for and interpret future
                  detections. We show that the number density of
                  interstellar objects implied by ’Oumuamua is
                  consistent with ’Oumuamua itself having originated
                  as an icy planetesimal ejected from a DSHARP-type
                  system via gravity assists, with the caveat that
                  ’Oumuamua’s lack of observed outgassing remains in
                  strong tension with a cometary origin. Under this
                  interpretation, ’Oumuamua’s detection points towards
                  a large number of long-period giant planets in
                  extrasolar systems, supporting the hypothesis that
                  the observed gaps in protoplanetary disks are carved
                  by planets. In the case that ’Oumuamua is an ejected
                  cometary planetesimal, we conclude that LSST should
                  detect up to a few interstellar objects per year of
                  ’Oumuamua’s size or larger and over 100 yr−1 for
                  objects with r {\textgreater} 1 m.},

  abstract =	 {Binary black holes (BBHs) detected by gravitational
                  wave (GW) observations could be broadly divided into
                  two formation channels: those formed through field
                  binary evolution and those assembled dynamically in
                  dense stellar systems. Each of these formation
                  channels, and their sub-channels, populate a
                  distinct region in the effective spin-mass
                  (\${\textbackslash}chi\_\{{\textbackslash}rm
                  eff\}-M\$) plane. Depending on the branching ratio
                  of different channels, an ensemble of BBHs could
                  show a trend in this plane. Here we fit a
                  mass-dependent distribution for
                  \${\textbackslash}chi\_\{{\textbackslash}rm eff\}\$
                  to the GWTC-1 BBHs from the first and second
                  observing runs of Advanced LIGO and Advanced
                  Virgo. We find a negative correlation between mass
                  and the mean effective spin
                  (\${\textbackslash}bar\{{\textbackslash}chi\}\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{eff\}\}\$),

                  at 75{\textbackslash}\% and 80{\textbackslash}\%
                  confidence. This trend is robust against the choice
                  of mass variable, but most pronounced when the mass
                  variable is taken to be the chirp mass of the
                  binary. The result is consistent with significant
                  contributions from both dynamically assembled and
                  field binaries in the GWTC-1 catalog. The upcoming
                  LIGO O3a data release will critically test this

  abstract =	 {The masses of the largest bodies that fell onto the
                  planets during their formation may be estimated from
                  the present inclinations of the planetary axes of
                  rotation. Earlier it was found that masses of the
                  largest bodies in the Earth's zone had to be of the
                  order of 10−3−10−2 of the Earth's mass. On the
                  contrary Marcus has found that the masses of the
                  largest bodies were comparable with the mass m0 of
                  the planet (up to 12 m0). In the present paper it is
                  shown that this result is a direct consequence of an
                  inverse power law assumed by Marcus for the mass
                  distribution of all bodies including the largest
                  one. A very simple method of estimation of the
                  ratios mkmk+1 found by Marcus with the aid of limit
                  theorems of the theory of probability is given. The
                  suggestion by Marcus that the collision speeds of
                  bodies were much lower than the velocity of escape
                  at their surfaces, made to avoid contradiction with
                  the data on the planetary rotation, is
                  untenable. However the inverse power law found for
                  small bodies is not valid for the largest
                  bodies. Owing to gravitation the effective cross
                  sections of large bodies considerably exceed their
                  geometrical cross sections and their ratios are
                  proportional to the fourth power of the ratios of
                  the radii of bodies. It is found that the ratio m0m1
                  of the mass of the first largest body to that of the
                  second one moving in the same zone increased with
                  time, approaching some limit that depended on the
                  relative velocities of bodies and was of the order
                  of 103. This figure agrees with the value found from
                  the data on the planetary rotation. The largest
                  bodies m0 had nearly circular orbits around the Sun
                  and determined the relative velocities of other
                  bodies in their zones. They may be considered as
                  planet “embryos” At an early stage there were many
                  such “embryos” in the zone of the formation of the
                  planet, because their masses were small and their
                  feeding zones were narrow. The masses of the embryos
                  increased, adjacent zones became overlapped, and the
                  smaller embryos fragmented or were absorbed by
                  larger ones. The greatest embryos gradually have
                  grown up into the present planets.},

                  extinction decreases, with planet magnitudes between
                  \$25\$ and \$35\$ mag. In the N-band, due to the
                  silicate feature on the dust opacities, the expected
                  magnitude increases to \$40\$ mag. For a \$2\$
                  \$M\_J\$ planet, the magnitudes in J-, H- and
                  K-bands are above \$22\$ mag, while for L-, M- and
                  N-bands the planet magnitudes are between \$15\$ and

                  extinction does not play a role in any IR band, due

                  type II migration regime. According to standard type
                  II theory, planets migrate at the same rate as the
                  gas in the disc, as they are coupled to the disc
                  viscous evolution; however, recent studies
                  questioned this paradigm, suggesting that planets
                  migrate faster than the disc material. We study the
                  problem through 2D long-time simulations of systems
                  consistent with type II regime, using the
                  hydrodynamical grid code FARGO3D. Even though our
                  simulations confirm the presence of an initial phase
                  characterised by fast migration, they also reveal
                  that the migration velocity slows down and
                  eventually reaches the theoretical prediction if we
                  allow the system to evolve for enough time. We find
                  the same tendency to evolve towards the theoretical
                  predictions at later times when we analyse the mass
                  flow through the gap and the torques acting on the
                  planet. This transient is related to the initial
                  conditions of our (and previous) simulations, and is
                  due to the fact that the shape of the gap has to
                  adjust to a new profile, once the planet is set into
                  motion. Secondly, we test whether the type II theory
                  expectation that giant planet migration is driven by
                  viscosity is consistent with our simulation by
                  comparing simulations with the same viscosity and
                  different disc mass (or viceversa). We find a good
                  agreement with the theory, since when the discs are
                  characterised by the same viscosity, the migration
                  properties are the same.},

  abstract =	 {About ten per cent of ‘massive’ stars (those of more
                  than 1.5 solar masses) have strong, large-scale
                  surface magnetic fields1–3. It has been suggested
                  that merging of main-sequence and pre-main-sequence
                  stars could produce such strong fields4,5, and the
                  predicted fraction of merged massive stars is also
                  about ten per cent6,7. The merger hypothesis is
                  further supported by a lack of magnetic stars in
                  close binaries8,9, which is as expected if mergers
                  produce magnetic stars. Here we report
                  three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamical simulations
                  of the coalescence of two massive stars and follow
                  the evolution of the merged product. Strong magnetic
                  fields are produced in the simulations, and the
                  merged star rejuvenates such that it appears younger
                  and bluer than other coeval stars. This can explain
                  the properties of the magnetic ‘blue straggler’ star
                  τ Sco in the Upper Scorpius association that has an
                  observationally inferred, apparent age of less than
                  five million years, which is less than half the age
                  of its birth association10. Such massive blue
                  straggler stars seem likely to be progenitors of
                  magnetars, perhaps giving rise to some of the
                  enigmatic fast radio bursts observed11, and their
                  supernovae may be affected by their strong magnetic
                  fields12.},

  abstract =	 {It is generally accepted that the four major
                  (Galilean) satellites formed out of the gas disk
                  that accompanied Jupiter's formation. However,
                  understanding the specifics of the formation process
                  is challenging as both small particles (pebbles) as
                  well as the satellites are subject to fast migration
                  processes. Here, we hypothesize a new scenario for
                  the origin of the Galilean system, based on the
                  capture of several planetesimal seeds and subsequent
                  slow accretion of pebbles. To halt migration, we
                  invoke an inner disk truncation radius, and other
                  parameters are tuned for the model to match
                  physical, dynamical, compositional, and structural
                  constraints. In our scenario it is natural that
                  Ganymede's mass is determined by pebble
                  isolation. Our slow-pebble-accretion scenario then
                  reproduces the following characteristics: (1) the
                  mass of all the Galilean satellites; (2) the orbits
                  of Io, Europa, and Ganymede captured in mutual 2:1
                  mean motion resonances; (3) the ice mass fractions
                  of all the Galilean satellites; (4) the unique
                  ice-rock partially differentiated Callisto and the
                  complete differentiation of the other
                  satellites. Our scenario is unique to simultaneously
                  reproduce these disparate properties.},

                  planet pair with orbital periods librating at a
                  nearinteger ratio (2/1, 3/2, 4/3, etc.) and are a
                  natural outcome of standard planetary formation
                  theories. Systems with multiple adjacent resonant
                  pairs are known as resonant chains and can exhibit
                  threebody resonances —characterized by a critical
                  three-body angle. Here we study three-body angles as
                  a diagnostic of resonant chains through
                  tidally-damped N-body integrations. For each
                  combination of the 2:1, 3:2, 4:3, and 5:4 mean
                  motion resonances (the most common resonances in the
                  known resonant chains), we characterize the
                  three-body angle equilibria for several mass
                  schemes, migration timescales, and initial
                  separations. We ﬁnd that under our formulation of
                  the three-body angle, which does not reduce
                  coeﬃcients, 180◦ is the preferred libration center,
                  and libration centers shifted away from 180◦ are
                  associated with non-adjacent resonances. We then
                  relate these angles to observables, by applying our
                  general results to two transiting systems: Kepler-60
                  and Kepler-223. For these systems, we compare N-body
                  models of the three-body angle to the zeroth order
                  in e approximation accessible via transit phases,
                  used in previous publications. In both cases, we ﬁnd
                  the three-body angle during the Kepler observing
                  window is not necessarily indicative of the
                  long-term oscillations and stress the role of
                  dynamical models in investigating three-body
                  angles. We anticipate our results will provide a
                  useful diagnostic in the analysis of resonant

                  by the DSHARP survey came to the conclusion that all
                  rings are just marginally optically thick with
                  optical depths between 0.2 and 0.5 at a wavelength
                  of 1.25 mm. This surprising result could either be
                  coincidental or indicate that the optical depth in
                  all of the rings is regulated by the same process.},

  url =		 {http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.11149},
  abstract =	 {We analytically derive the observed size-mass
                  relation of galaxies' atomic hydrogen (HI),
                  including limits on its scatter, based on simple
                  assumptions about the structure of HI discs. We
                  trial three generic profiles for HI surface density
                  as a function of radius. Firstly, we assert that HI
                  surface densities saturate at a variable threshold,
                  and otherwise fall off exponentially with radius or,
                  secondly, radius squared. Our third model assumes
                  the total gas surface density is exponential, with
                  the HI fraction at each radius depending on local
                  pressure. These are tested against a compilation of
                  110 galaxies from the THINGS, LITTLE THINGS, LVHIS,
                  and Bluedisk surveys, whose HI surface density
                  profiles are well resolved. All models fit the
                  observations well and predict consistent size-mass
                  relations. Using an analytical argument, we explain
                  why processes that cause gas disc truncation - such
                  as ram-pressure stripping - scarcely affect the HI
                  size-mass relation. This is tested with the
                  IllustrisTNG(100) cosmological, hydrodynamic
                  simulation and the Dark Sage semi-analytic model of
                  galaxy formation, both of which capture radially
                  resolved disc structure. For galaxies with
                  m\_*{\textgreater}10{\textasciicircum}9 M\_solar and
                  m\_HI{\textgreater}10{\textasciicircum}8 M\_solar,
                  both simulations predict HI size-mass relations that
                  align with observations, show no difference between
                  central and satellite galaxies, and show only a
                  minor, second-order dependence on host halo mass for
                  satellites. Ultimately, the universally tight HI
                  size-mass relation is mathematically inevitable and
                  robust. Only by completely disrupting the structure
                  of HI discs, e.g. through overly powerful feedback,
                  could a simulation predict the relation poorly.},

  abstract =	 {Galaxies represent the main form of organization of
                  matter in our universe. Therefore, they are of
                  obvious interest for the new multidisciplinary field
                  of astrobiology. In particular, to study
                  habitability of galaxies represents one of the main
                  emerging challenges of theoretical and numerical
                  astrobiology. Its theoretical underpinnings are,
                  however, often confused and vague. Here we present a
                  systematic attempt to list and categorize major
                  causal factors playing a role in emergent
                  habitability of galaxies. Furthermore, we argue that
                  the methodology of cosmological merger trees is
                  particularly useful in delineating what are
                  systematic and lawful astrobiological properties of
                  galaxies at present epoch vs. those which are
                  product of historical contingency and, in
                  particular, interaction with wider extragalactic
                  environment. Employing merger trees extracted from
                  cosmological N-body simulations as a new and
                  promising research method for astrobiology has been
                  pioneered by Stanway et al. (2018). We analyse the
                  general issue of applicability of merger trees and
                  present preliminary results on a set of trees
                  extracted from the Illustris Project. In a sense,
                  this approach is directly complementary to using
                  large-scale cosmological simulations to study
                  habitable zones of individual galaxies with high
                  mass/spatial resolution; taken together, they usher
                  a new era of synergy and synthesis between cosmology

                  accreting protostellar disks analogous to the
                  primordial solar nebula. Our main objective is to
                  determine the retention efficiency of dust
                  particles, which are the building blocks of the much
                  larger planetesimals. This study takes account of
                  the two-dimensional (radial and normal) structure of
                  the disk gas, including the effects of the variation
                  in the gas velocity as a function of distance from
                  the midplane. It is shown that the dust component of
                  disks accretes slower than the gas component. At
                  high altitude from the disk midplane (higher than a
                  few disk scale heights), the gas rotates faster than
                  the particles because of the inward pressure
                  gradient force, and its drag force causes particles
                  to move outward in the radial direction. Viscous
                  torque induces the gas within a scale height from
                  the disk midplane to flow outward, carrying small
                  (size ≲ 100 μm at 10 AU) particles with it. Only
                  particles at intermediate altitude or with
                  sufficiently large sizes (≳1 mm at 10 AU) move
                  inward. When the particles' radial velocities are
                  averaged over the entire vertical direction, the
                  particles have a net inward flux. The magnitude of
                  their radial motion depends on their distance from
                  the central star. At large distances, particles
                  migrate inward with a velocity much faster than the
                  gas accretion velocity. However, their inward
                  velocity is reduced below that of the gas in the
                  inner regions of the disk. The rate of velocity
                  decrease is a function of the particles' size. While
                  larger particles retain fast accretion velocity
                  until they approach closer to the star, 10 μm
                  particles have slower velocity than the gas in the
                  majority of the disk (r ≲ 100 AU). This differential
                  migration of particles causes size
                  fractionation. Dust disks composed mostly of small
                  particles (size ≲ 10 μm) accrete slower than gas
                  disks, resulting in an increase in the dust-gas
                  ratio during the gas accretion phase. If the gas
                  disk has a steep radial density gradient or if dust
                  particles sediment effectively to the disk midplane,
                  the net vertically averaged flux of particles can be
                  outward. In this case, the accretion of the dust
                  component is prevented, leading to the formation of
                  residual dust disks after their gas component is
                  severely depleted.},

  abstract =	 {On May 21, 2019 at 03:02:29 UTC Advanced LIGO and
                  Advanced Virgo observed a short duration
                  gravitational-wave signal, GW190521, with a
                  three-detector network signal-to-noise ratio of
                  14.7, and an estimated false-alarm rate of 1 in 4900
                  yr using a search sensitive to generic
                  transients. If GW190521 is from a quasicircular
                  binary inspiral, then the detected signal is
                  consistent with the merger of two black holes with
                  masses of \$85{\textasciicircum}\{+21\}\_\{-14\}
                  M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ and
                  \$66{\textasciicircum}\{+17\}\_\{-18\}
                  M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ (90 \% credible
                  intervals). We infer that the primary black hole
                  mass lies within the gap produced by (pulsational)
                  pair-instability supernova processes, and has only a
                  0.32 \% probability of being below \$65
                  M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$. We calculate the mass
                  of the remnant to be
                  \$142{\textasciicircum}\{+28\}\_\{-16\}
                  M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, which can be
                  considered an intermediate mass black hole
                  (IMBH). The luminosity distance of the source is
                  \$5.3{\textasciicircum}\{+2.4\}\_\{-2.6\}\$ Gpc,
                  corresponding to a redshift of
                  \$0.82{\textasciicircum}\{+0.28\}\_\{-0.34\}\$. The
                  inferred rate of mergers similar to GW190521 is
                  \$0.13{\textasciicircum}\{+0.30\}\_\{-0.11\}{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{Gpc\}{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{yr\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$.},

                  around HD 169142 reveal a peculiar structure made of
                  concentric dusty rings: a main ring at ∼ 20 au, a
                  triple system of rings at ∼ 55 − 75 au in
                  millimetric continuum emission and a perturbed gas

                  1) surface brightness proﬁle. In this Letter, we
                  perform three-dimensional numerical simulations and
                  radiative transfer modeling exploring the
                  possibility that two giant planets interacting with
                  the disc and orbiting in resonant locking can be
                  responsible for the origin of the observed dust

                  lived while the gas mass of the disc is accreted
                  onto the star and the giant planets, emptying the

                  innermost planet is located at the inner edge of the
                  dust ring, and can accrete mass from the disc,
                  generating a signature in the dust ring shape that

                  the habitability of worlds outside of our solar
                  system. They can stabilize conditions, alter the
                  climate by breaking tidal locking with the parent
                  star, drive tidal heating, and perhaps even host
                  life themselves. However, the ability of an
                  exoplanet to sustain an exomoon depends on complex
                  tidal interactions. Motivated by this, we make use
                  of simpliﬁed tidal lag models to follow the
                  evolution of the separations and orbital and
                  rotational periods in planet, star, and moon
                  systems. We apply these models to known exoplanet
                  systems to assess the potential for these exoplanets
                  to host exomoons. We ﬁnd that there are at least 36
                  systems in which an exoplanet in the habitable zone
                  may host an exomoon for longer than one
                  gigayear. This includes Kepler-1625b, an exoplanet

                  potential targets for future observation. In many
                  cases, there remains considerable uncertainty in the
                  composition of speciﬁc exoplanets. We show the
                  detection (or not) of an exomoon would provide an
                  important constraint on the planet structure due to

                  during the dissipation of a protoplanetary disk and
                  its possible role in exciting the orbits of
                  primordial asteroids, in the light of recent models
                  of solar system evolution. We develop an integrator
                  that incorporates the gravitational effect of a
                  uniformly (or not) depleting, axisymmetric disk with
                  arbitrary surface density profile; its performance
                  is verified by analytical calculations. The secular
                  response of fictitious asteroids, under
                  perturbations from Jupiter, Saturn and a decaying
                  disk, is thoroughly studied. Note that the existence
                  of a symmetry plane induced by the disk, lifts the
                  inherent degeneracy of the two-planet system, such
                  that the '\$s\_5\$' nodal frequency can also play a
                  major role. We examine different resonant
                  configurations for the planets (2:1, 3:2, 5:3), disk
                  models and depletion scenarios. For every case we
                  compute the corresponding time paths of secular
                  resonances, which show when and where resonance
                  crossing occurs. The excitation of asteroids,
                  particularly in inclination, is studied in the
                  various models and compared to analytical
                  estimates. We find that inclination excitation in
                  excess of \${\textbackslash}sim
                  10{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\}\$ is

                  uniform spread of \${\textbackslash}Delta

                  conserve their orbital eccentricity, since a
                  decrease in perigee of only 5-10\% would cause them
                  to crash. However, these satellites are subject to
                  gravitational perturbations from the Earth's
                  multipole moments, the Moon, and the Sun that are
                  not spherically symmetric and hence do not conserve
                  angular momentum, especially over the tens of
                  thousands of orbits made by a typical satellite. Why
                  then do satellites not crash? We describe a
                  vector-based analysis of the long-term behavior of
                  satellite orbits and apply this to several toy
                  systems containing a single non-Keplerian perturbing
                  potential. If only the quadrupole potential from the
                  Earth's equatorial bulge is present, all
                  near-circular orbits are stable. If only the
                  octupole potential is present, all such orbits are
                  unstable. If only the lunar or solar potential is

                  to the ecliptic exceeding 39 degrees are

                  the simultaneous presence of all of these
                  perturbations and show that almost all low Earth
                  orbits are stable because of an accidental property
                  of the dominant quadrupole potential. We also relate
                  these results to the phenomenon of Lidov-Kozai

                  conceived experiments that aim to demonstrate and
                  study the turbulent dynamo mechanism in the
                  laboratory. Here we describe the design of these
                  experiments through simulation campaigns using
                  FLASH, a highly capable radiation
                  magnetohydrodynamics code that we have developed,
                  and large-scale three-dimensional simulations on the
                  Mira supercomputer at Argonne National
                  Laboratory. The simulation results indicate that the
                  experimental platform may be capable of reaching a
                  turbulent plasma state and study dynamo
                  amplification. We validate and compare our numerical
                  results with a small subset of experimental data
                  using synthetic diagnostics.},

  abstract =	 {We performed three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic
                  simulations of planet migration in stratified disks
                  using the Godunov code PLUTO, where the disk is
                  turbulent due to the magnetorotational
                  instability. We study the migration for planets with
                  different planet-star mass ratios q = Mp /Ms . In
                  agreement with previous studies, for the low-mass
                  planet cases (q = 5 × 10–6 and 10–5), migration is
                  dominated by random fluctuations in the torque. For
                  a Jupiter-mass planet (q = Mp /Ms = 10–3 for Ms = 1M
                  ☉), we find a reduction of the magnetic stress
                  inside the orbit of the planet and around the gap
                  region. After an initial stage where the torque on
                  the planet is positive, it reverses and we recover
                  migration rates similar to those found in disks
                  where the turbulent viscosity is modeled by an α
                  viscosity. For the intermediate-mass planets (q = 5
                  × 10–5, 10–4, and 2 × 10–4), we find a new and so
                  far unexpected behavior. In some cases they
                  experience sustained and systematic outward
                  migration for the entire duration of the
                  simulation. For this case, the horseshoe region is
                  resolved and torques coming from the corotation
                  region can remain unsaturated due to the stresses in
                  the disk. These stresses are generated directly by
                  the magnetic field. The magnitude of the horseshoe
                  drag can overcome the negative Lindblad contribution
                  when the local surface density profile is flat or
                  increasing outward, which we see in certain
                  locations in our simulations due to the presence of
                  a zonal flow. The intermediate-mass planet is
                  migrating radially outward in locations where there
                  is a positive gradient of a pressure bump (zonal
                  flow).},

  abstract =	 {Dust particles need to grow efficiently from
                  micrometre sizes to thousands of kilometres to form
                  planets. With the growth of millimetre to meter
                  sizes being hindered by a number of barriers, the
                  recent discovery that dust evolution is able to
                  create `self-induced' dust traps shows promises. The
                  condensation and sublimation of volatile species at
                  certain locations, called snow lines, is also
                  thought to be an important part of planet formation
                  scenarios. Given that dust sticking properties
                  change across a snow line, this raises the question:
                  how do snow lines affect the self-induced dust trap
                  formation mechanism? The question is particularly
                  relevant with the multiple observations of the
                  carbon monoxide (CO) snow line in protoplanetary
                  discs, since its effect on dust growth and dynamics
                  is yet to be understood. In this paper, we present
                  the effects of snow lines in general on the
                  formation of self-induced dust traps in a parameter
                  study, then focus on the CO snow line. We find that
                  for a range of parameters, a dust trap forms at the
                  snow line where the dust accumulates and slowly
                  grows, as found for the water snow line in previous
                  work. We also find that, depending on the grains
                  sticking properties on either side of the CO snow
                  line, it could either be a starting or braking point
                  for dust growth and drift. This could provide clues
                  to understand the link between dust distributions
                  and snow lines in protoplanetary disc observations.},

  abstract =	 {In circumstellar discs, collisional grinding of
                  planetesimals produces second-generation dust. While
                  it remains unclear whether this ever becomes a major
                  component of the total dust content, the presence of
                  such dust, and potentially the substructure within,
                  it can be used to explore a disc's physical
                  conditions. A perturbing planet produces
                  nonaxisymmetric structures and gaps in the dust,
                  regardless of its origin. The dynamics of
                  planetesimals, however, will be very different than
                  that of small dust grains due to weaker gas
                  interactions. Therefore, planetesimal collisions
                  could create dusty disc structures that would not
                  exist otherwise. In this work, we use N-body
                  simulations to investigate the collision rate
                  profile of planetesimals near mean-motion
                  resonances. We find that a distinct bump or dip
                  feature is produced in the collision profile, the
                  presence of which depends on the libration width of
                  the resonance and the separation between the peri-
                  and apocenter distances of the edges of the
                  resonance. The presence of one of these two features
                  depends on the mass and eccentricity of the
                  planet. Assuming that the radial dust emission
                  traces the planetesimal collision profile, the
                  presence of a bump or dip feature in the dust
                  emission at the 2:1 mean-motion resonance can
                  constrain the orbital properties of the perturbing
                  planet. This assumption is valid, so long as radial
                  drift does not play a significant role during the
                  collisional cascade process. Under this assumption,
                  these features in the dust emission should be
                  marginally observable in nearby protoplanetary disks
                  with ALMA.},

                  six years of radial velocity (RV) follow-up from the
                  W. M. Keck Observatory HIRES spectrograph. Kepler-88
                  has two previously identified planets: Kepler-88 b
                  (KOI-142.01) transits in the NASA Kepler photometry
                  and has very large transit timing
                  variations. Nesvorny et al. (2013) perfomed a
                  dynamical analysis of the TTVs to uniquely identify
                  the orbital period and mass of the perturbing planet
                  (Kepler-88 c), which was later was confirmed with
                  RVs from the Observatoire Haute-Provence (OHP,
                  Barros2014). To fully explore the architecture of
                  this system, we performed photodynamical modeling on
                  the Kepler photometry combined with the RVs from
                  Keck and OHP and stellar parameters from
                  spectroscopy and Gaia. Planet d is not detectable in
                  the photometry, and long-baseline RVs are needed to
                  ascertain its presence. However, the orbital
                  parameters and masses of interacting planets b and c
                  are improved by an order of magnitude with respect
                  to the RV-only solution when the photometry is
                  included: \$P\_b
                  =10.91647{\textbackslash}pm0.00014\$ days,
                  \$M\_b=9.5{\textbackslash}pm

                  \$P\_c=22.2649{\textbackslash}pm0.0007\$ days, and
                  \$M\_c=214.2{\textbackslash}pm5.2{\textbackslash},M\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$. The
                  photodynamical solution also finds that planets b
                  and c have low eccentricites, are apsidally
                  anti-aligned, and have conjunctions on the same
                  hemisphere of the star. Continued RV follow-up of
                  systems with small planets will improve our
                  understanding of the link between inner planetary
                  system architectures and giant planets.},

                  (KOI-142.01) transits in the NASA Kepler photometry
                  and has very large transit timing variations
                  (TTVs). Nesvorný et al. performed a dynamical
                  analysis of the TTVs to uniquely identify the
                  orbital period and mass of the perturbing planet
                  (Kepler-88 c), which was later was confirmed with
                  RVs from the Observatoire de Haute-Provence
                  (OHP). To fully explore the architecture of this
                  system, we performed photodynamical modeling on the
                  Kepler photometry combined with the RVs from Keck
                  and OHP and stellar parameters from spectroscopy and
                  Gaia. Planet d is not detectable in the photometry,
                  and long-baseline RVs are needed to ascertain its
                  presence. A photodynamical model simultaneously
                  optimized to fit the RVs and Kepler photometry
                  yields the most precise planet masses and orbital
                  properties yet for b and c: , , , and . The
                  photodynamical solution also finds that planets b
                  and c have low eccentricites and low mutual
                  inclination, are apsidally anti-aligned, and have
                  conjunctions on the same hemisphere of the
                  star. Continued RV follow-up of systems with small
                  planets will improve our understanding of the link
                  between inner planetary system architectures and
                  giant planets.},

  abstract =	 {Recent observations of Kepler multi-planet systems
                  have revealed a number of systems with planets very
                  close to second-order mean motion resonances (MMRs,
                  with period ratio \$1:3\$, \$3:5\$, etc.) We present
                  an analytic study of resonance capture and its
                  stability for planets migrating in gaseous
                  disks. Resonance capture requires slow convergent
                  migration of the planets, with sufficiently large
                  eccentricity damping timescale \$T\_e\$ and small
                  pre-resonance eccentricities. We quantify these
                  requirements and find that they can be satisfied for
                  super-Earths under protoplanetary disk
                  conditions. For planets captured into resonance, an
                  equilibrium state can be reached, in which
                  eccentricity excitation due to resonant
                  planet-planet interaction balances eccentricity
                  damping due to planet-disk interaction. We show that
                  this "captured" equilibrium can be overstable,
                  leading to partial or permanent escape of the
                  planets from the resonance. In general, the
                  stability of the captured state depends on the inner
                  to outer planet mass ratio \$q=m\_1/m\_2\$ and the
                  ratio of the eccentricity damping times. The
                  overstability growth time is of order \$T\_e\$, but
                  can be much larger for systems close to the
                  stability threshold. For low-mass planets undergoing
                  type I (non-gap opening) migration, convergent
                  migration requires \$q {\textbackslash}lesssim 1\$,
                  while the stability of the capture requires
                  \$q{\textbackslash}gtrsim 1\$. These results suggest
                  that planet pairs stably captured into second-order
                  MMRs have comparable masses. This is in contrast to
                  first-order MMRs, where a larger parameter space
                  exists for stable resonance capture. We confirm and
                  extend our analytical results with \$N\$-body
                  simulations, and show that for overstable capture,
                  the escape time from the MMR can be comparable to
                  the time the planets spend migrating between
                  resonances.},

                  contain planets very close to mean motion
                  resonances, although there is no significant pileup
                  of precise resonance pairs. We present theoretical
                  and numerical studies on the outcome of capture into
                  first-order mean motion resonances (MMRs) using a
                  parametrized planet migration model that takes into
                  account nonlinear eccentricity damping due to
                  planet-disk interaction. This parametrization is
                  based on numerical hydrodynamical simulations and is
                  more realistic than the simple linear
                  parametrization widely used in previous analytic
                  studies. We find that nonlinear eccentricity damping
                  can significantly influence the stability and
                  outcome of resonance capture. In particular, the
                  equilibrium eccentricity of the planet captured into
                  MMRs become larger, and the captured MMR state tends
                  to be more stable compared to the prediction based
                  on the simple migration model. In addition, when the
                  migration is sufficiently fast or/and the planet
                  mass ratio is sufficiently small, we observe a novel
                  phenomenon of eccentricity overshoot, where the
                  planet's eccentricity becomes very large before
                  settling down to the lower equilibrium value. This
                  can lead to the ejection of the smaller planet if
                  its eccentricity approaches unity during the
                  overshoot. This may help explain the lack of
                  low-mass planet companion of hot Jupiters when
                  compared to warm Jupiters.},

                  vertical oscillations. We obtain a new result for
                  the diffusion of solids. The Schmidt number (ratio
                  of gas to particle diffusivity) is Sc≈1+(Ωtstop)2,
                  in terms of the particle stopping time tstop and the
                  orbital frequency Ω. The standard result,
                  Sc=1+tstop/teddy, in terms of the eddy turnover
                  time, teddy, is shown to be incorrect. The main
                  difference is that Sc rises quadratically, not
                  linearly, with stopping time. Consequently,
                  particles larger than ∼10 cm in protoplanetary disks
                  will suffer less radial diffusion and will settle
                  closer to the midplane. Such a layer of boulders
                  would be more prone to gravitational collapse. Our
                  predictions of RMS speeds, vertical scale height and

                  via aerodynamic drag, which generates radial drift
                  and triggers unstable modes. The secular instability
                  does not require self-gravity, yet it generates
                  growing particle-density perturbations that could
                  seed planetesimal formation. Growth rates are slower
                  than dynamical but faster than radial drift
                  timescales. Growth rates, like streaming velocities,
                  are maximized for marginal coupling (stopping times
                  comparable to dynamical times). Fastest growth
                  occurs when the solid-to-gas density ratio is order
                  unity and feedback is strongest. Curiously, growth
                  is strongly suppressed when the densities are too
                  nearly equal. The relation between background drift
                  and wave properties is explained by analogy with
                  Howard's semicircle theorem. The three-dimensional,
                  two-fluid equations describe a sixth-order (in the
                  complex frequency) dispersion relation. A terminal
                  velocity approximation allows simplification to an
                  approximate cubic dispersion relation. To describe

                  this fate, as migration continues the inclination
                  Ñips from 0¡ to i {\textbackslash} 180¡ ; thereafter
                  the eccentricity declines until the semimajor axis
                  is a factor of 9 smaller than at capture, at which
                  point the small body is released from the 2 : 1
                  resonance on a nearly circular retrograde
                  orbit. Small bodies captured into resonance from
                  initially inclined or eccentric orbits can also be
                  ejected from the system, or released from the
                  resonance on highly eccentric polar orbits (i
                  {\textasciicircum} 90¡) that are stabilized by a
                  secular resonance. We conclude that migration could
                  drive much of the inner planetesimal disk into the
                  star, and that postmigration multiplanet systems may
                  not be coplanar.},

                  protoplanetary disks with substructures that could
                  be induced by young forming planets. To explore the
                  properties of planets that may be responsible for
                  these substructures, we systematically carry out a
                  grid of 2D hydrodynamical simulations, including
                  both gas and dust components. We present the
                  resulting gas structures, including the relationship
                  between the planet mass, as well as (1) the gaseous
                  gap depth/width and (2) the sub/super-Keplerian
                  motion across the gap. We then compute dust
                  continuum intensity maps at the frequency of the
                  DSHARP observations. We provide the relationship
                  between the planet mass, as well as (1) the
                  depth/width of the gaps at millimeter intensity
                  maps, (2) the gap edge ellipticity and asymmetry,
                  and (3) the position of secondary gaps induced by
                  the planet. With these relationships, we lay out the
                  procedure to constrain the planet mass using gap
                  properties, and study the potential planets in the
                  DSHARP disks. We highlight the excellent agreement
                  between observations and simulations for AS 209 and
                  the detectability of the young solar system
                  analog. Finally, under the assumption that the
                  detected gaps are induced by young planets, we
                  characterize the young planet population in the
                  planet mass–semimajor axis diagram. We find that the

  abstract =	 {We present the results of our recent study on the
                  interactions between a giant planet and a
                  self-gravitating gas disk. We investigate how the
                  disk's self-gravity affects the gap formation
                  process and the migration of the giant planet. Two
                  series of 1-D and 2-D hydrodynamic simulations are
                  performed. We select several surface densities and
                  focus on the gravitationally stable region. To
                  obtain more reliable gravity torques exerted on the
                  planet, a refined treatment of disk's gravity is
                  adopted in the vicinity of the planet. Our results
                  indicate that the net effect of the disk's
                  self-gravity on the gap formation process depends on
                  the surface density of the disk. We notice that
                  there are two critical values,
                  {\textbackslash}Sigma\_I and
                  {\textbackslash}Sigma\_II. When the surface density
                  of the disk is lower than the first one,
                  {\textbackslash}Sigma\_0 {\textless}
                  {\textbackslash}Sigma\_I, the effect of self-gravity
                  suppresses the formation of a gap. When
                  {\textbackslash}Sigma\_0 {\textgreater}
                  {\textbackslash}Sigma\_I, the self-gravity of the
                  gas tends to benefit the gap formation process and
                  enlarge the width/depth of the gap. According to our
                  1-D and 2-D simulations, we estimate the first
                  critical surface density {\textbackslash}Sigma\_I
                  {\textbackslash}approx 0.8MMSN. This effect
                  increases until the surface density reaches the
                  second critical value
                  {\textbackslash}Sigma\_II. When
                  {\textbackslash}Sigma\_0 {\textgreater}
                  {\textbackslash}Sigma\_II, the gravitational
                  turbulence in the disk becomes dominant and the gap
                  formation process is suppressed again. Our 2-D
                  simulations show that this critical surface density
                  is around 3.5MMSN. We also study the associated
                  orbital evolution of a giant planet. Under the
                  effect of the disk's self-gravity, the migration
                  rate of the giant planet increases when the disk is
                  dominated by gravitational turbulence. We show that
                  the migration timescale associates with the
                  effective viscosity and can be up to
                  10{\textasciicircum}4 yr.},

                  rotating near their break-up limit shed mass
                  centrifugally, creating Be stars with circumstellar
                  discs and possibly driving outbursts. Using the mesa
                  stellar evolution code, we examine the effects of
                  efficient angular momentum transport on the
                  main-sequence and post-main-sequence rotational
                  evolution of massive stars. In rapid rotators,
                  angular momentum transported from the contracting
                  core to the expanding envelope can spin-up the
                  surface layers past the break-up rate, particularly
                  for stars near (or beyond) the end of the

                  increases both the likelihood and the intensity of

  abstract =	 {Spirals in protoplanetary discs have been used to
                  locate the potential planet in discs. Since only the
                  spiral shape from a circularly orbiting perturber is
                  known, most previous works assume that the planet is
                  in a circular orbit. We develop a simple
                  semi-analytical method to calculate the shape of the
                  spirals launched by an eccentric planet. We assume
                  that the planet emits wavelets during its orbit, and
                  the wave fronts of these propagating wavelets form
                  the spirals. The resulting spiral shape from this
                  simple method agrees with numerical simulations
                  exceptionally well. The spirals excited by an
                  eccentric planet can detach from the planet,
                  bifurcate, or even cross each other, which are all
                  reproduced by this simple method. The spiral's
                  bifurcation point corresponds to the wavelet that is
                  emitted when the planet's radial speed reaches the
                  disc's sound speed. Multiple spirals can be excited
                  by an eccentric planet (more than 5 spirals when
                  $e\gtrsim0.2$). The pitch angle and pattern speed
                  are different between different spirals and can vary
                  significantly across one spiral. The spiral wakes
                  launched by high-mass eccentric planets steepen to
                  spiral shocks and the crossing of spiral shocks
                  leads to distorted or broken spirals. With the same
                  mass, a more eccentric planet launches weaker
                  spirals and induces a shallower gap over a long
                  period of time. The observed unusually large/small
                  pitch angles of some spirals, the irregular multiple
                  spirals, and the different pattern speeds between
                  different spirals may suggest the existence of
                  eccentric perturbers in protoplanetary discs.},

                  spiral structure in protoplanetary disks. Previous
                  studies have suggested that planet-induced spiral
                  arms cannot explain these spiral patterns, as 1) the
                  pitch angle of the spiral arm is larger in
                  observations than that predicted by the linear
                  density wave theory, 2) the contrast of the spiral
                  arm is higher in observations than in synthetic
                  observations based on two dimensional planet-disk
                  simulations. We have carried out three dimensional
                  (3-D) hydrodynamical simulations to study spiral
                  wakes/shocks excited by young planets. We find that,
                  in contrast with linear theory, the pitch angle of
                  spiral arms does depend on the planet mass, which
                  can be explained by the non-linear density wave
                  theory. The more massive is the planet, the larger
                  pitch angle the spiral arm has. A secondary spiral
                  arm, especially for the inner arms, is also excited
                  by the planet. The more massive is the planet, the
                  larger is the separation in the azimuthal direction
                  between the primary and secondary arms. We also find
                  that although the arms in the outer disk do not
                  exhibit much vertical motion, the inner arms have
                  significant vertical motion, which boosts the
                  density perturbation at the disk atmosphere by more
                  than a factor of 10 compared with that at the disk
                  midplane. Combining hydrodynamical models with
                  Monte-Carlo radiative transfer calculations, we find
                  that the inner spiral arms are considerably more
                  prominent in synthetic near-IR images using full 3-D
                  hydrodynamical models than images based on 2-D
                  models, indicating the need to model observations
                  with full 3-D hydrodynamics. Overall, spiral arms
                  (especially inner arms) excited by planetary-mass
                  objects are prominent features that are observable
                  by current near-IR imaging facilities, and the shape
                  of the spiral arms informs us not only about the
                  position but also about the mass of the companion.},

  abstract =	 {We report relations between inner ({\textless}1 au)
                  super Earths (planets with mass/radius between Earth
                  and Neptune) and outer ({\textgreater}1 au) giant
                  planets (mass {\textgreater} 0.3 M J, or cold
                  Jupiters) around Sun-like stars, based on data from
                  both ground-based radial velocity (RV) observations
                  and the Kepler mission. We find that cold Jupiters
                  appear three times more often around hosts of super
                  Earths than they do around field stars. Given the
                  prevalence of the super Earth systems, their cold
                  Jupiters can account for nearly all cold
                  Jupiters. In other words, cold Jupiters are almost
                  certainly (∼90\%) accompanied by super Earths. A few
                  corollaries follow: (1) around metal-rich ([Fe/H]
                  {\textgreater} 0.1) stars, the fraction of super
                  Earths with cold Jupiters can rise to 60\% or
                  higher; (2) the inner architecture can be strongly
                  impacted by the outer giant and we report some
                  observational evidence for this; (3) planetary
                  systems like our own, with cold Jupiters but no
                  super Earths, should be rare (∼1\%). The strong
                  correlation between super Earths and cold Jupiters
                  establish that super Earths and cold Jupiters do not
                  compete for solid material, rather, they share
                  similar origins, with the cold Jupiter formation
                  requiring a somewhat more stringent
                  condition. Lastly, we propose a few immediate
                  observational tests of our results, using
                  ground-based RV observations and ongoing/planned
                  space missions.},

                  empirical success, but only recently have we begun
                  to develop a rigorous understanding of why it
                  performs so well on difficult problems and how it is
                  best applied in practice.  Unfortunately, that
                  understanding is confined within the mathematics of
                  differential geometry which has limited its
                  dissemination, especially to the applied communities
                  for which it is particularly important. In this
                  review I provide a comprehensive conceptual account
                  of these theoretical foundations, focusing on
                  developing a principled intuition behind the method
                  and its optimal implementations rather of any
                  exhaustive rigor. Whether a practitioner or a
                  statistician, the dedicated reader will acquire a
                  solid grasp of how Hamiltonian Monte Carlo works,
                  when it succeeds, and, perhaps most importantly,
                  when it fails.},

                  simulate the dynamics of our solar system's Sun,
                  planets, and large moons from 30 years of trajectory
                  data.  We then use symbolic regression to discover
                  an analytical expression for the force law
                  implicitly learned by the neural network, which our
                  results showed is equivalent to Newton's law of
                  gravitation. The key assumptions that were required
                  were translational and rotational equivariance, and
                  Newton's second and third laws of motion. Our
                  approach correctly discovered the form of the
                  symbolic force law. Furthermore, our approach did
                  not require any assumptions about the masses of

                  were accurately inferred through our
                  methods. Though, of course, the classical law of
                  gravitation has been known since Isaac Newton, our
                  result serves as a validation that our method can
                  discover unknown laws and hidden properties from

  abstract =	 {Artificial intelligence (AI) has undergone a
                  renaissance recently, making major progress in key
                  domains such as vision, language, control, and
                  decision-making. This has been due, in part, to
                  cheap data and cheap compute resources, which have
                  fit the natural strengths of deep learning. However,
                  many defining characteristics of human intelligence,
                  which developed under much different pressures,
                  remain out of reach for current approaches. In
                  particular, generalizing beyond one's experiences--a
                  hallmark of human intelligence from infancy--remains
                  a formidable challenge for modern AI.  The following
                  is part position paper, part review, and part
                  unification. We argue that combinatorial
                  generalization must be a top priority for AI to
                  achieve human-like abilities, and that structured
                  representations and computations are key to
                  realizing this objective. Just as biology uses
                  nature and nurture cooperatively, we reject the
                  false choice between "hand-engineering" and
                  "end-to-end" learning, and instead advocate for an
                  approach which benefits from their complementary
                  strengths. We explore how using relational inductive
                  biases within deep learning architectures can
                  facilitate learning about entities, relations, and
                  rules for composing them. We present a new building
                  block for the AI toolkit with a strong relational
                  inductive bias--the graph network--which generalizes
                  and extends various approaches for neural networks
                  that operate on graphs, and provides a
                  straightforward interface for manipulating
                  structured knowledge and producing structured
                  behaviors. We discuss how graph networks can support
                  relational reasoning and combinatorial
                  generalization, laying the foundation for more
                  sophisticated, interpretable, and flexible patterns
                  of reasoning. As a companion to this paper, we have
                  released an open-source software library for
                  building graph networks, with demonstrations of how
                  to use them in practice.},
